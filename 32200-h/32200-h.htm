<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE SERMON.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Four</span> girls were together in a pleasant
cottage room with a large window, over
which fluttered some dry sticks, which
would in due time bear clematis and
Virginia creeper leaves.</p>

<p>Three of them were Miss Lee's apprentices,
and this room had been built
out at the back of the baker's shop for
them. The place was the property of
the Lee family themselves, and nobody in
Langley was more respected than they
were. Ambrose Lee, whose name was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
over the baker's shop, and who kept
a horse and cart, was always called
Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>He had married a pretty, delicate
young girl, who had soon fallen into
such hopeless ill-health, that his sister
Charlotte was obliged to live at home
to attend to her and to the shop. And
when young Mrs. Lee died, leaving
three small children, another sister,
Rose, gave up her place to help in
the care of her old father and the
little ones.</p>

<p>Rose Lee had been a sewing maid, and,
being clever, had become a very fair dressmaker;
so she took in needlework from
the first, and when good old master Lee
died, and the children had grown old
enough to be more off her hands, she
became the dressmaker and sempstress of
the place, since there was no doubt that
all she took in hand would be thoroughly
well turned out of hand, from a child's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
under garment up to Mrs. and Miss
Manners's dresses. "For," as her sister
Charlotte proudly said of her, "the ladies
had everything made down here, except
one or two dresses from London for the
fashion." Her nephews were both from
home, one as a pupil-teacher, the other
at a baker's with a superior business,
and her niece, Amy, the only girl of the
family, had begun as a pupil-teacher,
but she had such bad headaches at the
end of her first year that her father
was afraid to let her go on studying for
examinations, and cancelled her engagement,
and thus she became an assistant
to her aunt. Then Jessie Hollis, from
the shop, came home from her aunt's,
unwilling to go to service, and begged
Miss Lee to take her and teach her
dressmaking; and, having thus begun,
she consented, rather less willingly, to
take likewise Florence Cray from the
Manners Arms, chiefly because she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
known her mother all her life, and believed
her to be careful of the girl;
besides which, it was a very respectable
house.</p>

<p>As plain work, as well as dressmaking,
was done, there was quite enough employment
for all the hands, as well as for the
sewing machine, at which Amy, a fair,
delicate-looking girl, was whirring away,
while Jessie was making the button-holes
of a long <i>princesse</i> dress, and Florence
tacking in some lining; or rather each
was pausing a little in her work to
answer Grace Hollis, Jessie's sister, a
businesslike-looking young person, dressed
in her town-going hat and jacket, who
had stepped in, on her way to meet the
Minsterham omnibus, to ask whether
Miss Lee wanted to have anything done
for her, and likewise how many yards of
narrow black velvet would be wanted for
the trimming of her own and Jessie's
spring dresses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Lee was gone up to the house for
a grand measuring of all the children for
their new frocks; but Amy began to calculate
and ask questions about the width
and number of rows, and Jessie presently
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"After all, I think mine will look very
well without any round the skirt."</p>

<p>"Why, Jessie, I thought you said the
dress you saw looked so genteel with the
three rows&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jessie; "but I have
thought since&mdash;" and she hesitated and
blushed.</p>

<p>Amy got up from the machine, came
towards her, and, laying her hand on her,
said, gently&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know, Jessie."</p>

<p>"And I know, though you wanted to
keep it a secret!" cried Florence. "I
was at church too last night!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I saw you, Florence; and
wasn't it beautiful?" said Amy, earnestly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Most lovely! It is worth something
to have a stranger here sometimes to get
a fresh hint from!" said Florence.</p>

<p>"I call that more than a hint," said
Jessie, in a low voice. "I am so glad
you felt it as I did, Flossy."</p>

<p>"Felt it! You don't mean that you
got hold of it? Then you can tell
whether it was cut on the bias, and how
the little puffs were put on!"</p>

<p>"Why, what are you thinking of,
Flossy?" exclaimed Amy. "Bias&mdash;puffs!
One would think you were talking of a
dress!"</p>

<p>"Well, of course I was. Of that lovely
self-trimming on that cashmere dress of
the lady that came with Miss Manners.
What&mdash;what are you laughing at,
Grace?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Florence," said Amy, in a disappointed
tone; "we thought you meant
the sermon."</p>

<p>"The sermon?" said Florence, half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
annoyed, half puzzled; "well, it was a
very good one; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It did make one feel&mdash;oh, I don't
know how!" said Jessie, much too eager
to share her feelings with the other girls,
even to perceive that Florence wanted to
go off to the trimming.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it beautiful&mdash;most beautiful&mdash;when
he said it was not enough only
just not to be weeds, or to be only flowers,
gay and lovely to the eye?" said Amy.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Jessie; "he said that
we might see there were some flowers
just for beauty, all double, and with no
fruit or good at all in them, but dying
off into a foul mass of decay."</p>

<p>"Ay," said Grace; "I thought of your
dahlias, that, what with the rain and the
frost, were&mdash;pah!&mdash;the nastiest mess at
last."</p>

<p>"Then he said," proceeded Jessie,
"that there were some fair and comely,
some not, but only bringing forth just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
their own seeds, not doing any real good,
like people that keep themselves to themselves,
and think it is enough to be out
of mischief and do good to themselves
and their families."</p>

<p>"And didn't you like it," broke in
Amy, "when he said that was not what
God asked of us? He wanted us to
be like the wheat, or the vine, or the
apple, or the strawberry, some plain in
blossom, some fair and lovely to look at,
but valued for the fruit they bring forth,
not selfishly, just to keep up their own
stock, but for the support and joy and
blessing of all!"</p>

<p>"One's heart just burnt within one,"
continued Jessie, "when he bade us each
one to go home and think what we could
do to bring forth fruit for the Master,
some thirty, some sixty, some an hundredfold.
Not only just keeping oneself
straight, but doing something for Christ
through His members."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only think of its being for Christ
Himself," said Amy softly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Grace, "I thought we
might take turns to go to Miss Manners's
missionary working parties. I never gave
in to them before, but I shall not be comfortable
now unless I do something. And
was that what you meant about the velvet
trimming, Jessie? It will save&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fifteen pence," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;or you may say threepence
more. So we can put that into
the box, if you like. I must be going
now, and look sharp if I'm to catch the
bus. So good-bye, all of you."</p>

<p>"Oh! but won't you have the self-trimming,"
broke in Florence. "Perhaps
she'll be there on Friday night, and then
we might amongst us make out how it is
done."</p>

<p>"Florence Cray, for shame!" said Grace.
"I do believe you minded nothing but
that dress all through that sermon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Florence, who was a
good-humoured girl, "there was no helping
it, when there it was just opposite in
the aisle, and I'd never seen one like it;
and as to the sermon, you've just given it
to me over again, you've got it so pat;
and I'll go to the missionary work meeting
too, Grace, and very like the young
lady will be there, and I can see her
trimming."</p>

<p>"If you go for that, I would go to a
fashion-book at once," said Grace; "but
I must really be off now, I've not another
minute to stop."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, I forgot," cried Florence,
jumping up, "I was to ask you to call for
our best tea-pot at Bilson's. And my
mother wants a dozen&mdash;" and there her
voice was lost as she followed Grace out of
the room through the shop, and even along
the road, discoursing on her commissions.</p>

<p>Amy and Jessie were left together, and
Amy stood up and said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear, I am so glad you felt it as I
did!"</p>

<p>"One could not help it, if one listened
at all," said Jessie. "Amy, I must be
doing something for His sake. I can't
rest now without it. You teach at
the Sunday school. Don't you think I
might?"</p>

<p>Amy meditated a little.</p>

<p>"I think they would make up a class for
you. When Miss Pemberton's niece goes
away, the class she takes has to be joined
to her aunt's, and that makes a large
one."</p>

<p>"Then will you speak to Miss Manners
for me?" asked Jessie. "Are they
little girls or big ones?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the second class. They
would be sure not to give you that," said
Amy, as if she thought the aspiration
very high, not to say presumptuous. "Perhaps
Margaret Roller, the pupil-teacher,
you know, may take that. Then I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
have hers and you mine. They are dear
little girls, some of them, only Susan
Bray always wants a tight hand over her,
Polly Smithers is so stupid, and Fanny
Morris is so sly, one always has to be on
the watch."</p>

<p>"Here she comes," said Florence, who
was the nearest to the window, and the
entrance of Aunt Rose, a brisk, fair
little woman, young looking for her age,
recalled all her "young ladies," as Florence
and Jessie, and perhaps Amy likewise,
preferred being called, to recollect
that stitching was, at that moment at
least, the first thing to be attended to.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE SUNDAY SCHOOL.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> Amy's business-like tone about
the school classes fell a little flat upon
Jessie's ear. She had not been to a Sunday
school in her childhood. Her father
had been a prosperous upholsterer's foreman
in Minsterham, and Grace and Jessie
had gone to an "academy" till, when
they were sixteen and fourteen years old,
their father died of a fever, and their
mother, who had a cottage of her own at
Langley, resolved on coming back and
setting up a small shop there for all sorts
of wares, with Clementina Hollis over
the door.</p>

<p>Jessie was about eighteen, two years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
younger than her sister. She had always
been a bright, quick, lively girl, but never
very thoughtful, and much too inquisitive,
till her curiosity had brought on her
a terrible accident, which had kept her
laid up in a hospital for many weeks.
She had come home quite well at last,
and much improved. A fellow patient,
and likewise a lady who had visited her
and lent her books, had both made much
impression on her. She cared about right
and wrong as she had never done before,
was more useful at home, and tried to
restrain her inclination to find out all
about everything; she said her prayers
more carefully, went to Church more
often, and heeded more what she heard;
and altogether she was what her mother
called an altered girl. This was Lent,
and a clergyman was staying with Mr.
Somers to preach a course of sermons on
the Friday evenings, and it was one of
these that had so much struck these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
young girls, and had put into their minds
for the first time, with any real force,
the full sense that the true Christian
must seek to work for the good of the
household of Christ as well as his own
household, and that "bringing forth good
fruit" does not simply mean taking care
of oneself, and trying to save one's own
soul.</p>

<p>The language had been beautiful and
stirring, and there was a burning desire
in more than one heart to be doing something
for Christ's sake. The first thing
that Jessie thought of was the Sunday
school. She had read books about it,
and her fellow patient was full of ardour
about "training little lambs," as she
called it, so that it seemed the most
beautiful and suitable task she could
undertake.</p>

<p>Amy Lee, on the other hand, hardly
knew how to spend a Sunday without
the school. She had been a scholar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
there until she had quite outgrown the
first class, and had been more than a
year confirmed, and then she had become
a teacher of the little ones. She liked
the employment, and was fond of the
children; she would have been sorry to
drop the connection with Miss Manners
or with Miss Joy, the mistress, and the
rest of the school staff; she was pleased
to work for and with Mr. Somers and
Miss Manners, and she had been trained
to be reverent and attentive; but it had
never occurred to her to think of it as
more than a nice and good thing to do,
or to look on it as a work undertaken
for Christ's sake.</p>

<p>"Teaching at school, I do that already,"
she said to herself, when Aunt Rose's
entrance had made her work her machine
more and her tongue less. "I must get
something more to do. Oh! I know.
There's poor old half-blind Mrs. Long.
She is left to herself terribly, they do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
say, and I'll go and tidy her up, and see
to her and read to her every day. I
could do it before my work and after.
Maybe I might get her to be a better
old woman than she ever has been.
Books say that nothing so softens an
old woman as a nice, bright young girl
coming in to make much of her, and
I'm sure I'm nice and bright&mdash;not so
much in myself, but compared with the
whole lot of Longs."</p>

<p>So Amy told her plan to her aunts,
as soon as Florence and Jessie had gone
home to dinner.</p>

<p>The two aunts looked at one another,
and Aunt Charlotte said, "Did the
sermon make you think of that?" in
rather a doubtful tone.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Amy. "One seemed to
long to be doing some good, not be only
an empty flower, as he said."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Long," said Aunt Rose; "she
ain't a very nice person to fix upon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"But no one wants it so much, aunt,"
said Amy.</p>

<p>"That's true," said Aunt Charlotte.
"Well, Amy, we must think about it,
and speak to your father. Run out
now, and gather a bit of parsley for
his cheese."</p>

<p>Amy knew it was to get her out of
the way, and felt rather disappointed
that the proposal was not seized upon
at once, and applauded.</p>

<p>"She's a good girl," said Aunt Rose.</p>

<p>"Well, so she is, and I don't like to
stand in her way," said Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>"But to pitch on old Sally Long of
all folk in the world!" said Rose.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt but she does want
something done for her; but I misdoubt
me if she will choose our Amy to do it.
Besides, I don't like her tongue. That's
what daunts me most."</p>

<p>"Yes. If she took it kind of the girl,
she would never be satisfied without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
talking to her of all the old backbiting
tales that ever was! And we that have
kept our girl up from hearing of all evil
just like a lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Ambrose Lee,
himself coming in, after putting up his
cart.</p>

<p>"Why, that sermon last night has
worked upon our Amy, so that she wants
to do something extra," said Aunt Rose.</p>

<p>"A right down good sermon it was,"
said the father; "a bit flowery, to suit
the maidens, I suppose."</p>

<p>"And she said it all off to me, quite
beautiful," said Rose, who had stayed at
home.</p>

<p>"And what does the child want to be
doing? I won't have her go back to her
books again, to worry her head into
aching."</p>

<p>"No, that's not what she wants. Her
notion is to run in and out and see to
old Widow Long."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Widow Long!" exclaimed the baker.
"Why, she's got as slandering a tongue
as any in the parish! Give the poor
old soul a loaf or a sup of broth if you
like, but I'll not have my girl running in
and out to hear all the gossip of the
place, and worse."</p>

<p>"I knew you would say so, Ambrose,"
returned Charlotte. "All the same, the
child's thought shames me that I've
never done anything for the poor old
thing; and she won't harm me."</p>

<p>Ambrose chuckled a little. "I don't
know but aunt likes a spice of gossip as
much as her niece. 'Tis she tells us all
the news."</p>

<p>"Well, I can get plenty of that in the
shop, without going to Dame Long for
it," said Charlotte, laughing. "I like
the real article, genuine and unadulterated."</p>

<p>They were laughing at Aunt Charlotte's
wit when Amy came in, and she looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from one to the other, afraid they were
laughing at her project, and ready to be
offended or hurt. She did not like it
when her father said, "Look here, my
girl, Aunt Charlotte says Dame Long's
dish of tongue is too spicy for you, and
she must have it for herself."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, father,"
said Amy, nearly crying, "I didn't want
it for that."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't, child," said Charlotte;
"but come along here, I want you to help
me dish up."</p>

<p>Amy came with the tears standing in
her eyes into the back kitchen, vexed,
angered, and ready to be cross. Her
aunt set her to prepare the dish for the
Irish stew, while she said, "Father was
at his jokes with me, Amy. He don't
like you to be running in and out to old
Sally Long by yourself; no more does
your Aunt Rosy nor I; but the poor old
body didn't ought to be neglected, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the sermon was just as much for me as
for you, so I've made up my mind to look
after her a bit, and you may come in
with me sometimes if you like."</p>

<p>"That was not what I meant," said
Amy, rather fretfully.</p>

<p>"I dare say not. There, mind what
you are about, or you'll have that dish
down. Where's the flour? Come, now,
Amy, don't be daunted, if you can't do
good quite in your own way; why
shouldn't you ask Miss Dora now?"</p>

<p>Amy muttered and pouted. "I'm not
such a child now!"</p>

<p>"Ain't you then, to be making such a
pout at not getting just your own way."</p>

<p>Down came the dish with a bounce on
the table, and away ran Amy up the
stairs, where she cried and choked, and
thought how hard it was that she should
be hindered, and laughed at, and scolded,
when she wanted to do good, and bring
forth the fruit of good works.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>She heard Aunt Rose ask where she
was, and her Aunt Charlotte answer,
"Oh! she will be down in a minute."</p>

<p>She felt it kind that no one said that
she was in the sulks. The relief did her
good; she could not bear that any
one should guess what was amiss. So
she washed her face in haste, tidied her
hair and collar, and hoped that she looked
as if she had gone up for nothing else.</p>

<p>Perhaps her father had had a hint, and
she was his great pet, so he took care that
the apprentices should not suspect that
Amy had been "upset." So he began to tell
what had made him late at home. He
had overtaken poor Widow Smithers in
much trouble, for she had had a note
from the hospital to say that her little
boy, Edwin, must be discharged as incurable.
It was a hip complaint, and he
could not walk, and she had not been
able to find any way of getting him home.</p>

<p>It so happened that all the gentlefolks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
were out for the day, and she did not
get her letter in time before the market
people set off. She was indeed too poor
to hire a conveyance, and was going in,
fearing that she might have to carry this
nine-year-old boy herself five miles unless
she could get a lift. So Mr. Lee had
driven her into the town, and after doing
his work there, had come up to the hospital,
and had taken her in with poor
little Edwin, who was laid on a shawl in
the cart, but cried a good deal at the
jolting. The doctors said that they could
do no more for the poor little fellow, and
she would have to take him home and
do the best she could for him.</p>

<p>It fell very hard upon her, poor woman,
for she was obliged to go out to work
every day, since she had four children,
and only Harry, the one who was older
then Edwin, earned anything&mdash;and indeed
he only got three shillings a week for
minding some cows on the common. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
two girls <i>must</i> go to school, and indeed
they were too young to be of much use
and the boy would have to be left alone
all day, except for the dinner hour, as he
had been before the hospital had been
tried for him.</p>

<p>"There, Amy," said Aunt Charlotte,
as they were clearing away the dinner
things after the menfolk had gone out,
"there's something you could do. It
would be a real kindness to go in and
see after that poor little man."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Rose; "you might run
in at dinner time, and I'd spare you a
little time then, and you might read to
him, and cheer him up&mdash;yes, and teach
him a bit too."</p>

<p>"Edwin Smithers was always a very
tiresome, stupid little boy," said Amy,
rather crossly, from her infant school
recollections.</p>

<p>"Then he will want help all the more,"
said Aunt Rose, and it sounded almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
like mimicry of what Amy had said of
old Mrs. Long.</p>

<p>She did not like it at all. It is the
devices of our own heart that we prefer
to follow, whether for good or harm, and
specially when we think them good. And
yet we specially pray that we may do all
such good works as our Lord hath <i>prepared
for us to walk in</i>, as if we were to
rejoice in having our opportunities set
out before us, yet the teaching a dull
little boy of whom she had had experience
in the infant school, did not seem
to her half such interesting work as
converting an old woman of whom strange
things were said.</p>

<p>However, Amy was on the whole a
good girl, though she had her little
tempers, and did not guard against them
as she ought, thinking that what was soon
over did not signify.</p>

<p>By and by, Jessie came back radiant
with gladness, and found a moment to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
say, before Florence Cray came in, that
her mother was quite agreeable to her
teaching in the Sunday school, if Miss
Manners liked it. She had gone there
herself for some years when she and Miss
Manners were both young, and she was
well pleased that her daughter should be
helpful there.</p>

<p>Amy, who was fond of Jessie, was delighted
to think of having her company
all the way to school, and her little fit
of displeasure melted quite away. But
when Florence was heard coming in, both
girls were silent on their plans, knowing
that she would only laugh at their wishing
to do anything so dull.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE WORKING PARTY.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Are</span> these fruits of the sermon on
Friday night?" said Miss Manners to
Mr. Somers, as they finished winding up
their parish accounts on Monday morning.
"Not only, as you know, here is
Grace Hollis wanting to join Mrs.
Somers's Tuesday working parties, Jessie
begging to help at the Sunday school;
but I find that good little Amy Lee went
and sat with poor Edwin Smithers for
half an hour on Sunday after church,
showing him pictures, and she has promised
his mother to come and look in
on him every day. It is very nice of the
Lees to have thought of it, and to spare
her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Somers, "the Lees
are always anxious to do right."</p>

<p>"I had a talk with Charlotte just now.
She came to get some flannel for Mrs.
Long. She says she will make it up for
her, if the old woman can have it out of
the club. Well, she says it is quite
striking how all those girls have been
moved by Mr. Soulsby's sermon on
Friday evening. Amy came home and
nearly said it all off to her Aunt Rose,
and the girls were all talking about it
in the workroom in the morning, full of
earnestness to make some effort."</p>

<p>"I saw they were looking very attentive,"
said Mr. Somers. "Shall you
accept Jessie Hollis's help?"</p>

<p>"I think I can make a class up for her."</p>

<p>"I suppose it would be a pity to check
her, but do you imagine that she knows
anything?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but she is not at all
a stupid girl, and she cannot go far wrong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with the questions on the Catechism and
Gospels that I shall give her. Indeed I
had thought of asking her and Margaret
Roller, and, perhaps, Amy Lee, to come
and prepare the lessons here on Friday
evenings after church."</p>

<p>"A good plan," said Mr. Somers, "if
it be not giving you too much to do."</p>

<p>"Not a bit, especially at this time of
year, when nobody wants me in the
evenings. My only doubt is whether it
is not keeping the girls out too late, but
I will see whether it can be managed.
The children might be better taught, and
the teachers might learn something themselves
in this indirect way."</p>

<p>Perhaps this was Miss Dora's way of
acting on the sermon, but she could not
begin that week, as a friend was coming
to spend the Friday with her.</p>

<p>Meantime Grace Hollis had joined
the working party that met every Tuesday
afternoon for an hour to make clothes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for a very poor district in London. She
had been sometimes known to say that
it was all waste of time to make things
and send them away to thriftless, shiftless
folk; but she had heard something
of the love of our neighbour, and our
membership with the rest of our Lord's
Body, which had touched her heart. So
she brought her thimble and needle, to
join the working party who sat round the
Rectory dining-table. Mrs. Somers and
Miss Manners shook hands, made her welcome,
and found her a seat and some work.
Grace looked about her to be sure who
the party were. Mrs. Nowell, the gardener's
wife, sat next to her. Then came
little Miss Agnes from the Hall, sewing
hard away, and Lucy Drew from Chalk-pit
Farm, who was about her age, next
to her, and old Miss Pemberton knitting.</p>

<p>"A mixed lot," said Grace to herself,
and then her eye lit upon deformed
Naomi Norris, of whom she did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
approve at all. Did not the girl come
of a low dissenting family, and had not
her father the presumption to keep a
little shop in Hazel Lane which took away
half the custom, especially as they pretended
to make toffee? Meanwhile here
was Miss Wenlock, the governess at the
squire's, and Miss Dora reading aloud to
the party in turn. It was the history of
some mission work in London, and Miss
Lee, who was there, listened with great
pleasure, as did many of the others. Indeed
she well might, for her eldest sister's
son hoped one day to be a missionary.
But Grace was not used to being read
to, and, as she said, "it fidgeted her
sadly," and she was wondering all the
time what mistakes mother would make
in the shop without her, and she began
to be haunted with a doubt whether she
had put out a parcel of raisins that Farmer
Drew's man was to call for. The worry
about it prevented her from attending to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a word that was read; indeed she could
hardly keep herself from jumping up,
making up an excuse, and rushing home
to see about the raisins!</p>

<p>Then she greatly disapproved of the
shape of the bedgown she had been set to
make, and did not believe it would sit
properly. It was ladies' cutting towards
which she felt contemptuous, and yet she
would have thought it impolite to interfere.
Besides, it might make the whole
sitting go on longer, and Grace was burning
to get home. At last the reading
ended, but oh! my patience, that creature
Naomi was actually putting herself forward
to ask some nonsensical question, where
some place was, and Miss Agnes must
needs get a map, and every one go and
look at it&mdash;Grace too, not to be behindhand
or uncivil to the young ladies;
but had not she had enough of maps
and such useless stupid things long ago
when she left school at Miss Perkins's?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>When at last this was over, Mrs.
Somers came and spoke to her while she
was putting on her hat, and thanked her
pleasantly, saying that she was afraid
that beginning in the middle of a book
made it less interesting, but that one day
more would finish it. Then she added
"I don't like the pattern of that bedgown,
do you?"</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Somers, not at all," replied
Grace. "It quite went against me to
put good work into it."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you could help us
to a better shape next time," said Mrs.
Somers. "We should be very much
obliged to you. This pattern came out
of a needlework book, and I am not
satisfied about it."</p>

<p>Grace promised, and went away in
better humour, but more because she had
been made important than because she
cared for what she had been doing. She
was glad no one could say she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
been behindhand with her service, but it
was a burthen to her, and she did not
open her mind to enter into it so as to
make it otherwise.</p>

<p>Indeed, her mind was more full of her
accounts and the bad debts, and of the
cheapest way of getting in her groceries
than of anything else. As she walked
back through the village she wondered
whether Mrs. Somers and Miss Manners
would send to her mother's for their brown
sugar this summer. That would make
it worth while to go to a better but more
expensive place, and have in a larger
stock; and Grace went on reckoning the
risk all the time, and wondering whether
the going to the working parties would
secure the ladies' custom. In that case
the time would not be wasted. It did
not come into Grace's head whether what
she had thought of for the service of God
she might be turning to the service of
Mammon, if she only just endured it for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the sake of standing well with the gentry.
But then, was it not her duty to consider
her shop and her mother's interest?</p>

<p>She was quite vexed and angry when
she saw Jessie go and fetch the big
Family Bible that evening, turning off the
whole pile of lesson-books to which it
formed the base.</p>

<p>"Now what can you be doing that
for?" she said sharply.</p>

<p>"I want to prepare my lesson for to-morrow,"
said Jessie.</p>

<p>"And is not a little Bible good enough
for you, without upsetting the whole
table?"</p>

<p>"My Bible has got no references," said
Jessie.</p>

<p>"And what do little children like that
want of references? If you are to be
turning the house upside down and
wasting time like that over preparing as
you call it, I don't know as ma will let
you undertake it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have ironed all the collars and cuffs,
Grace," said Jessie; "yes, and looked
over the stockings."</p>

<p>Grace had no more to say; she knew
Jessie had wonderful eyes for a ladder or
a hole; but it worried her and gave her a
sense of disrespect that the pyramid which
surmounted the big Bible should be interfered
with, or that the Book itself should
have its repose interfered with "for a
pack of dirty children," when it had
never been opened before except to register
christenings, or to be spread out and
read when some near relation died, as
part of the mourning ceremony.</p>

<p>It really made her feel as if something
unfortunate had happened to see the
large print pages on the little round table,
and her sister peering into the references
and looking them out in her own little
Bible, then diligently marking them.</p>

<p>Her mother, too, asked what Jessie
was about, and though she did not say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
anything against her employment, their
looking on, and the expression on Grace's
face, worried Jessie so much that she
could not think, and only put a slip of
paper into her own book at each she
found. The chapter she had chosen was
the Parable of the Sower, on which she
had once heard a sermon. She was amazed
to find how many parallel passages
there were, and how beautifully they explained
one another when she made time
for comparing them on Sunday morning.
She saw herself beforehand expounding
them to the children, and winning their
hearts, as her friend in the hospital had
described, and she was quite ready in her
neat black silk and fur jacket, with a
little blue velvet hat, when Amy Lee
came to call for her, in her grey merino,
black cloth coat, and little hat to match.</p>

<p>They met Miss Manners at the school
door, and were pleasantly greeted, and
taken into the large cheerful room, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
hung round with maps and pictures,
where the classes were assembling, and
one or two of the other teachers had
come.</p>

<p>The bell was heard ringing, and while
the children trooped in, Miss Manners
showed Jessie a chair with some books
laid open upon it, the class register on the
top, and said:</p>

<p>"I am sorry there has not been time to
talk over your work this week; but I
have laid out the books for you, and if
you are in any difficulty come and ask
me."</p>

<p>By this time the children had come in
and taken their places, and Jessie was
pleased to see that her class was of children
of eight or nine years old&mdash;not such
little ones as Amy had threatened her
with. Miss Manners went to the harmonium
and gave out a Sunday morning
hymn, which was very sweetly sung, and
then she read prayers, everybody kneeling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and making the responses, so that
Jessie enjoyed it greatly, and felt quite
refreshed by the prayer for a blessing on
the teachers and the taught. Then Miss
Manners told the eight little girls who
stood in a row that Miss Hollis would
teach them, and she hoped they would
be very good and steady and obedient,
and say their lessons perfectly.</p>

<p>Jessie knew all but two who came
from the other end of the parish, and
were not customers of her mother&mdash;at
least she knew what families they belonged
to, and had only to learn their
Christian names from her list.</p>

<p>"Collect, please teacher," said the first
girl, Susan Bray, very much in the voice
in which she would have said "Candles,
please miss," in the shop.</p>

<p>The Prayer-book was uppermost, and
Jessie found she had to hear the Collect
for the day repeated by five perfectly, by
two rather badly, and one broke down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
altogether. The question-book lay open
under it. Some of the questions were
very easy, but of others Jessie was
not sure that the children were right
when they replied to some quite glibly,
and she was not sure how to help them
in others.</p>

<p>Then followed the opening of books
again. Jessie was longing to give out
all she had to say about the Sower, and
began bidding them turn to it in St.
Matthew, but Susan Bray stopped her
most decisively. "Oh! please teacher,
we've done that ever so long ago. We
always reads the Gospel for the day, and
here's the question-book, and it's got
answers." And she thrust it right under
the nose of Jessie, who by this time did
not quite love Miss Susan Bray. She
had plainly been sharp enough to see
when her teacher was at fault.</p>

<p>The children read the Gospel for the
day. It was Refreshing Sunday, so it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was not a difficult one; the children were
ready with the answers till the application
came, and then Jessie had again to
help them, which she did by reading the
printed answers and making them repeat
them after her, word for word. While
she was doing this with Mary Smithers,
who certainly was dulness itself, at one
end of the class, there was a whispering
at the other, and she saw two children
trying on each other's gloves, and she
quickly put an end to that, and went on
with another question and answer. The
moment her eye was off Susan Bray and
Lily Bell, however, they began comparing
some gay cards. Jessie turned on them:
"You are playing with those things.
Give them to me."</p>

<p>Lily Bell began to cry, and Susan
pertly said, "It's our markers, teacher."</p>

<p>"I don't care. I won't have you idle.
Give them to me, this instant."</p>

<p>Just then the church bell began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
ring, and there was a general moving;
but Jessie would not be beaten, and
caused the two cards to be given up to
her. The girls both cried with all their
might while she was marking the class
down, and, as they no doubt intended,
Miss Manners came to see what was the
matter.</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am, teacher has taken
away our markers, and we shan't know
where our Psalms is."</p>

<p>"They were playing with them," said
Jessie.</p>

<p>"We wasn't. We was finding our
Psalms," said Susan.</p>

<p>"You should not have done so while
Miss Hollis was teaching," said Miss
Manners. "I hope, if she is good
enough to give them back to you, that
you will attend better in the afternoon."</p>

<p>Jessie felt it all a little flat and disappointing,
all the more so that Amy
Lee joined her, and talked all the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to church about the children, who had
all passed through her hands when she
was a pupil teacher, telling all their
little tiresome ways. It seemed to rub
off all the gloss, and to change her
scheme of feeding the young lambs for
the Great Shepherd's sake into a mere
struggle with tiresome, fidgety children.</p>

<p>Still her hopes and her spirits rose
again at church. She had her expounding
of the Sower on her mind, and hoped
yet to deliver it when she went to afternoon
school; but there proved to be the
Catechism and a whole set of hymns to
be said, and questions to be asked about
them. These questions did not come
very readily to such an unpractised
tongue as hers, and she thought she
could lead off into the discourse she had
thought out over the Bible. But she
had hardly gone through twenty words
before she saw a squabble going on
between Lily Bell and Mary Smithers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and she had no sooner separated them,
and taken up the thread of her discourse
about grace being sown and watered in
our hearts, than Susan Bray popped up
up with "Please, teacher, it's time to
read to us&mdash;Its <i>Miss Angelina</i>," pointing
to a little gay story-book.</p>

<p>"You should not be rude, and interrupt,"
said Jessie; whereupon Susan
pouted, the two idlest began to play
with each other's fingers, and, as soon
as she paused to take breath, Lily Bell
jumped up, and brought her the book
open.</p>

<p>She had to give up the point, and
begin to read something that did not
seem to her nearly so improving as her
own discourse, as it was all about a doll
left behind upon a heath; but the children
listened to it eagerly.</p>

<p>Was this all the good she was to do
by sacrificing all her time on Sunday?
Like Grace, she felt much inclined to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
it up, and all the more when Florence
Cray came into the work-room the next
morning, laughing and saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, the impudence of some folk!
There was that there little Bray! I hear
that she should say that Miss Hollis was
put to teach her, and she warn't agoing
to care for one as wasn't a lady."</p>

<p>"I can make her mind me fast enough,"
said Amy.</p>

<p>"O, you are bred to be a teacher,"
said Florence; "that doesn't count.
Nobody else should trouble themselves
with the tiresome little ungrateful things.
I'm sure I wouldn't; but then I don't set
up for goodness, nor want to be thought
better than other folk."</p>

<p>Jessie had known that something of
this kind would be said, and was prepared
for it; but the child's speech vexed her
sorely. However, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm not going to be beat by a chit
like that," and at that moment Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Lee came in, and that kind of chatter
ceased.</p>

<p>But Jessie's cheeks burned over her
work, and she thought how foolish she
had been to let her fancy for doing good,
and trying to live up to the sermon, lead
her where she was allowed to do nothing,
but get herself teased and insulted, right
and left.</p>

<p>Should she give up? That would look
so silly. Yes, but would it not serve
Miss Manners right for giving her such
stupid, unspiritual kind of teaching to
do, and also serve the children right for
their pertness and ingratitude?</p>

<p>No, she could not give up in this way.
She had begun, and she must go on, at
least till she had some reason for giving
up respectably and civilly&mdash;only she
wished she had known how unlike it
was to what she had expected before she
had undertaken it!</p>

<p>Then she was sensible of a certain odd,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
uppish, self-asserting feeling within her.
She used to have it in old times, but she
had learnt to distrust it, and to know
that it generally came when she was in
a bad way.</p>

<p>Was she thinking of pleasing herself,
or of offering a little work to please God,
and try to let the good seed turn to good
fruit? Ah! but was it all a mistake?
Was becoming a mark for Susan Bray to
worry, doing any good at all?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>TEACHER AMY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a pleasant sight for Amy when
poor little Edwin Smithers's pale face
brightened up, as she opened his door.</p>

<p>He was not like the rough little monkey
she had known at the infant school, who
had only seemed to want to learn as little,
and to play as many tricks, as he could.
In the hospital, the attention kind people
had paid him had quickened up his understanding,
and mended his manners.
He had been petted and amused there,
and the being left alone in the dull
cottage was a sad trial to him. His
mother had regular work, and so had
his elder brother, but this kept them out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
all day from eight till five, except that
Mrs. Smithers kept Friday to do her own
washing in. She was obliged to be away
even at dinner time, as her work lay far
from home, and she gave her next-door
neighbour, Mrs. Rowe, a shilling a week
to keep up the fire, look in on the sick
boy, and give him his dinner.</p>

<p>She was unlucky in her neighbour.
Many women would have gladly given
far more kind service for no pay at all,
but they were too far off, and Mrs. Rowe
made it a rule to "do nothing for nothing."</p>

<p>His brother and sisters came in for a little
while at twelve, their dinner time, but
they wanted to go out to play, and had
no notion of amusing him; indeed he
was glad when they went away; Charlie
clumped about so, and made such a noise,
and little Jenny would take away his
picture books or the toys that had been
given him in the hospital.</p>

<p>Then Polly would call her a naughty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
girl, and snatch them from her, and so
his little wooden horse lost its head, and
his railway train was uncoupled, and one
wheel pulled off; and when old Mrs.
Rowe found him crying, all she said was,
"Dear! dear! don't ye fret now, don't
ye!" and when that did not make him
stop crying, she said he was a bad boy
to make such a work about nothing.
When she was a girl, nobody had frail
trade like that, all painted and gaudy, to
play with; a bit of an oyster-shell or a
crab's claw was enow for them. He had
got into such a caddle as never was too!</p>

<p>So she began to shake up his couch,
not in the least guessing how she was
hurting and jarring his poor hip; and
when he cried out and tried to drive her
away, she thought it was all naughtiness,
and declared that he was such a bad
boy that she should go away and leave
him to himself.</p>

<p>The Lees dined at one, and work did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
not begin till two; so Amy had a good
half-hour to spend on the little boy
before she was wanted again.</p>

<p>"Going to see Ted, be ye?" said Mrs.
Rowe, as she stood at her door, while
Amy opened the wicket. "A proper
fractious little to-&auml;d he be, upon my word
an' honour! They do spile children in
them hospitals, so as one can't do nothing
with 'em."</p>

<p>Amy looked at Mrs. Rowe, a very
clean woman, but with a face and fists
that looked as if they had been cut out
of the toughest part of an old pollard
ash, and a mouth that shut up like the
snap of a gin. "Poor little fellow!" said
Amy, and in she went.</p>

<p>She was on her knees at once by the
poor little boy, coaxing him and comforting
him, and feeding him with some
of the stew that Aunt Charlotte had kept
warm for him. Then he told how Polly
had taken away his horse and his train<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and broken them. Amy looked about,
and presently found the wheel. A little
hooking together was all the repair the
train wanted, and Edwin was soon happy
with it; while, as to the horse, he was
past Amy's present mending, but she
would take it home, and next time father
had out the glue-pot she would put on
the head.</p>

<p>Then Amy brought out a little book
with the early Bible history in pictures.
She showed Edwin one every day when
she came, and told him about it whenever
he did not know the story before, or
helped him to enter a little more into
it. She was surprised sometimes to find
that he had carried notions away from
school even when she had thought him
only dull and giddy. Then he was
pleased to say over the hymns he had
learnt in the infant school, and to talk
a little about it. Amy was quite surprised
to find how his mind had grown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
since he had been ill, and how pleased he
was to be taught a little verse of prayer
to say when he was in pain.</p>

<p>She made him quite comfortable, filled
up his mug of water, which the other
children had upset, put some primroses in
a cup where he could look at them, wrote
a copy on his slate, and ruled some lines,
caught the cat and put her before him,
found the place in his easy story-book,
and left him with a kiss, promising to
come again to-morrow.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant to be the bright
spot in that poor little life; and Amy
that afternoon stitched into little Miss
Hilda's tucks, to the whirr of her machine,
a whole pensive castle in the air about
the dear little fellow who was not long
for this world, and whose pillow was
cheered and his soul trained for Paradise
by his dear teacher, who came day by day
to lead him in the path to Heaven. The
tears came into her eyes at the thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of how beautiful and touching it would
all be&mdash;how she would lay a wreath of
white roses on his coffin, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you winking about, Amy?
Go nearer the window if you want more
light," said Aunt Rose, in a brisk, business-like
voice, not at all like her dreams.</p>

<p>Amy was glad to move, feeling a little
ashamed of being detected in crying beforehand
about her own good works; and
as she approached the window, she looked
out over the lemon-plant and exclaimed&mdash;"There's
Miss Manners!"</p>

<p>Miss Manners was really coming into
the shop, and her little Skye terrier was
already running on into the work-room,
for he was great friends with Amy; he
sniffed about, sat up, and gave his paw,
and let her show off his tricks while his
mistress was talking to Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>Then she came on, nodded kindly a
little greeting to each as they all rose,
and said that she had been thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that it would be a good thing for all the
teachers to meet for half an hour before
evensong on Fridays and look over their
Sunday work together, so as to make
it chime together. She said she found
it was done at Ellerby, and was very
helpful to all; and perhaps, when he
had time, Mr. Somers would come in
and help them. If they looked over the
subjects beforehand, they could note the
difficulties, and then she could refer to
books, or ask Mr. Somers.</p>

<p>Amy and Jessie both uttered some
thanks, and Aunt Rose observed that it
was very kind in Miss Dora, and that it
would be very nice for the girls. Florence
did not speak, but they saw her face and
the gesture of her foot, and when Miss
Lee walked out with the lady through
the garden, Florence broke out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, how fond some folks are of
being put to school, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"'Tisn't school," said Amy, "it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
reading with Miss Manners in her
drawing-room."</p>

<p>"O yes; she makes you think yourselves
ladies just to keep on grinding you
at the teaching for ever; but I likes my
fun when my work's done. I don't wonder
at Amy Lee&mdash;she knows nothing
better than sitting poked up and prim in
Miss Manners's room; but for you, Jessie
Hollis, who have seen a bit of the world,
I should have thought you'd have more
spirit than not even to be let to teach
half a dozen dirty children without
having your instructions."</p>

<p>Here Miss Lee returned, and Florence
applied herself to tacking in the lining
again, while Jessie muttered to herself,
"If I'm to teach them at all, I'd rather
do it properly."</p>

<p>Jessie really wished it. Perhaps the
notion of seeing the inside of Miss
Manners's drawing-room made it doubly
pleasant, for Jessie had eyes that really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
could not help taking note of everything,
though there was no harm in that when
she kept them in due control. She had
been in the dining-room before, and she
hoped much that the class would be in
the other room, though she was half
ashamed of caring.</p>

<p>Grace came home better satisfied on
Tuesday, because her patterns had been
much appreciated, though she still said
the reading worrited her, and Naomi
Norris gave herself airs.</p>

<p>Jessie and Amy, however, went together
on Friday, and found Margaret
Roller, the pupil teacher, and Miss Pemberton,
an elderly farmer's daughter,
who always taught the little ones on
Sunday, were ready there, and in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>How pretty it was, with fresh delicate
soft pink and white cretonne covers, and
curtains worked with&mdash;was it really a
series of old nursery tales? And coloured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
tiles, with &AElig;sop's fables round the fireplace,
pictures, books, and pretty things
that all looked as if they had a history.
Jessie's bright eyes took note of all in a
flash, and then she tried to command
them. Miss Manners gave them all their
greeting, settled them all comfortably,
and then began by reading to them a
short paper in a little book upon the
spirit of the whole Sunday, asking them
in turn to look out and read the texts
referred to, which Margaret and Amy did
with a rapidity that astonished Jessie.</p>

<p>Once she lost the thread in wondering
what was looking out of a half-opened
basket; but she caught herself up, and
found that there was infinitely more connection
and meaning in the passages
appointed for the Sunday than she had
ever guessed.</p>

<p>Then Miss Manners asked whether they
had any questions to ask; Margaret had
one or two, which sounded very hard to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Jessie, and she would never have thought
of. It was the Fifth Sunday in Lent for
which they were preparing, and they were
respecting the unusually long and difficult
Gospel for the day. Margaret wanted to
know whether the words "By whom do
your sons cast them out?" really meant
that devils were actually cast out by the
Jews. Miss Manners thought they were,
and she looked out, and showed Margaret,
a very curious account of the seal and
sacred words of exorcism which were
supposed to come from Solomon; but she
advised the teachers not to dwell much
on this branch of the subject, but to draw
out most the portion about the strong
man armed, and the warning against the
return of Satan to the soul whence he
had been once driven out.</p>

<p>Then Jessie observed that she had not
thought such things happened in these
days, and Miss Manners had to explain to
her how the possession then permitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was here treated as an allegory to all
times, of the evil once cast off returning
again if not resolutely excluded by prayer
and a strong purpose blessed by the grace
of God.</p>

<p>It soon became plain to Jessie that she
was ignorant of much which the others
knew quite well, and when the Church bell
began to chime, and all rose to go, she
obtained a moment in which to say,
with something like a tear in her eye&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed, Miss Manners, I ought not
to have undertaken it. I see I am not
fit to teach."</p>

<p>"I do not think you can tell without
a longer trial," was the answer, kindly
given.</p>

<p>"But I am so ignorant!" said Jessie.
"There is so much in these things that I
never thought of, and the others seem to
know all about it."</p>

<p>"It has been their regular Sunday
school round for years," said Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Manners, "so it would be strange if they
did not. But perhaps you will do all
the better for coming to it fresh; and I
am sure you are willing to take pains
and prepare."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jessie, slowly, "if&mdash;&mdash;You'll
excuse me, Miss Manners, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please say it, Jessie," said the lady;
"or shall I say it for you? This asking
idle children very simple questions does
not seem to you to be spiritual enough to
be doing much good?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, if you will excuse me.
I thought there was to be more expounding
of Scripture."</p>

<p>"We must do what we can <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word was added to the text">to</ins> get the
children to attend to," said Miss Manners.
"Even if we could get them to
sit still while we expounded, I am afraid
they would not attend or take in what
we said. Nothing is of use with such
young things but keeping them on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
alert with questions, and trying to keep
up their attention by being alive with
them ourselves. We must try to put
into them the sense of God's love to
them, of their own duty, and so on; but
rather by the tone of our questions about
the lessons they learn than by discoursing
long to them. You can only fill a little
narrow-mouthed pitcher with a few drops
at a time put right in. If you pour
a great stream over it, most will splash
over, and very little go in. I am afraid
the children were tiresome last Sunday.
It is their nature always to try their
strength with a new teacher; but if you
are firm and gentle, and show them that
you <i>will</i> be minded, and keep them interested,
they will soon be manageable.
Then, Jessie, there is good hope that you
may be sowing good seed, though you
and I may not always see the fruit here,
and it is nearly sure to be long before we
can even trace the green blade."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE TROUSSEAU.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Manners's</span> words stayed with
Jessie. She had plenty of sense and
spirit, as well as a real wish to do
right, and a yearning to spread the great
Light round her. To be sure, the going
to some mission in a dreadfully ignorant
and wicked place would have seemed
more like a good work than just taking
a class who would be taught and cared
for even without her help.</p>

<p>But she could see that if she could not
keep these tidy little trained children in
order, she would not have much chance
with the street Arabs she had read of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>She got on much better the next
Sunday. She kept the children interested
almost all the time, all except
the two lowest, who were determined to
chatter till she made one stand on each
side of her, and then one of them, Emma
Lott, chose to howl till Miss Manners
came to see what was the matter; but
she did not get much by that, for she
was only told that she was very naughty
not to mind Miss Hollis, and desired to
stop crying directly, which she did; and
then Miss Manners asked Miss Hollis to
be so kind as not to take away her ticket,
if she would try to behave well for the
rest of the day.</p>

<p>Once more Lily Bell was so kind as
to inform "teacher" that Susan said
"she didn't care, not for she." To which
Jessie coolly answered that she hoped
Susan would soon learn to care for being
a good girl, taking care not to look the
least mortified, so that the information<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fell very flat. After that she had no
more trouble with sauciness from the
children; she began to find that Susan
was clever and bright, and that Kate
May and Lucy Elwood were very nice
little maidens, who seemed to care to be
good. They brought her flowers, told
her funny little bits of news about baby
beginning to walk, and mother going to
Ellerby, and she found the time spent
at school a very pleasant part of her
Sunday; while as to the hours of preparation
with Miss Manners, she enjoyed
them so much that it was quite a blank
if that lady had any engagement to prevent
her from receiving her little party
of teachers.</p>

<p>Jessie found herself learning much
more than she taught. Her quick nature
could not but look into everything thoroughly,
and when she had been once
shown how to throw all her mind as well
as her soul into the study of the Bible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and Prayer-book, she found ever new
delight in them. She began to find it
helped her to pray with her understanding,
as well as with her spirit at Church;
to care more for her prayers at home, and
to feel more on the times of the Holy
Communion. She made her last year's
hat serve again with a fresh tulle trimming,
that she might buy herself a
"Teacher's Bible," and not worry her
mother and Grace any more by disturbing
the big one, since they thought it honouring
such a Bible to let it alone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollis did read the Psalms and
one Lesson every day. She said she had
once promised Amy Lee, aunt to the
present Amy, and she had hardly ever
missed doing so.</p>

<p>But Grace had not time. Just after
Whitsuntide the daughter of a very rich
farmer in the neighbourhood was engaged
to be married, and wanted a
quantity of fine work to be done for her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
making underlinen and embroidering
marks to handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>She came with her mother to offer the
work to Miss Lee, giving six weeks for
it, but it was more than Aunt Rose thought
right to undertake in the time. She said
she could not get it done without disappointing
several persons, and that she
was very sorry, but that she could only
undertake two sets of the things in the
time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robson, the mother, was vexed
and half angry. She said she hated common
shop-work, and ready-made things,
and she had taken a fancy to what she
had seen of Miss Lee's work. She even
offered to increase the payment, but Rose
Lee stood firm. She said there was no
one at hand whom she could hire and
entrust with such work, and that she
could not feel it right to undertake it,
as it would only lead to breaking her
engagements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, very well; I see you don't care
to oblige me," said the lady, twirling off
with her very tight skirts, and whisking
up a train like a fish's tail. "No, I will
not break the set. I am not accustomed
to refusals."</p>

<p>And off the two ladies drove, and Jessie
told the story at home with a great deal
of spirit.</p>

<p>"Now that's just like Rose Lee," said
Grace. "She won't make a bit of exertion
for her own good!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jessie, "you know we
should have to work awfully hard if she
took it in hand."</p>

<p>"I suppose she would have paid you
for extra hours," said Grace sharply.</p>

<p>"Miss Rose said it was the way to
ruin a girl's health to set her to do such
a lot of work," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"And quite right too," put in her
mother. "I knew a girl who was apprenticed
to a dressmaker, and sat up five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
nights when they had two black jobs one
after the other, and that girl's eyes never
was the same again!"</p>

<p>"Besides," added Jessie, "there's so
much in hand."</p>

<p>"Well, it might not do to offend Mrs.
or Miss Manners, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, it is not that! The children's
things were sent home yesterday. I wish
you could have seen them, they were
loves; and Miss Manners has got a new
dress from London. She let Miss Lee
see it, and take the pattern of the trimming.
No, but Mrs. Drew has sent her
Swiss cambric to be made up for Miss
Alice, and Miss Pemberton has a new
carmelite to be finished, and there are
some dresses for the maids at the hall,
all promised by Midsummer day."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Customers like that can wait."</p>

<p>"I don't see that it is a bit more right
to disappoint them than any one else,"
said Jessie sturdily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Old Miss Pemberton, to be compared
with a lady like that!" exclaimed Grace.</p>

<p>"It doesn't make much odds as to right
or wrong," said Jessie, "but I don't think
Mrs. Robson is much of a lady, to judge
by the way she gave her orders and
flounced off in a huff."</p>

<p>"A lady," said Mrs. Hollis, contemptuously,
"I should think not. Why, her
father kept the 'White Feathers' at
Ellerby; and Robson, he rose up just by
speculations, as they call them; but I've
seen him a little greengrocer's errand-boy,
with a face like a dirty potato."</p>

<p>"They can pay, any way," said Grace.
"Folks say Robson could buy out our
squire, ay, and my lord himself, if he
chose."</p>

<p>"And I'm sure," said Jessie, "she and
her daughter had clothes on that must
cost forty or fifty pounds apiece. Such a
fur cloak, lined with ermine; and the
young lady's jacket was sealskin, trimmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
ever so deep with sable, and a hummingbird
in her hat. They say little Miss
Hilda saw her and cried for pity of the
poor dear little bird."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you what," said Grace,
"I'll set off this minute to Newcome
Park, and see if I can't get the work, or
at least some of it. You and I can do
plain work as well any day as Rose Lee,
Jessie."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jessie, "but I have my
time at Miss Lee's all the same."</p>

<p>"Of course, child; but there are the
evenings, and I can sit to it while mother
minds the shop."</p>

<p>"Don't undertake more than you can
manage, Grace," said Mrs. Hollis.</p>

<p>"Trust me for that, mother. You can
wash up, Jessie; I can get there before
they go to dress for dinner. It is a
capital thing! It will just make up for
that bad debt of Long's, and help us to get
in a real genteel stock of summer goods."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Grace managed the house, and her
mother, who durst not say a word when
she was set on a thing; and as to Jessie,
her sister always treated her as a rather
naughty, idle child.</p>

<p>The girl had struggled hotly against
this, but it had always ended in getting
into such a temper, and saying such fierce
and violent things, that she had been
much grieved and ashamed of herself, and
now felt it better to let Grace have her
way than to get into a dispute which was
sure to make her do wrong.</p>

<p>But when Grace, as neat as a new pin,
had tripped out of the house, Mrs. Hollis
and Jessie looked at one another, as if
they had a pretty severe task set them.</p>

<p>"Well, I think we could have managed
without," said Mrs. Hollis, "but to be
sure it is as well to be on the safe side;
though I'd rather be without the money
than be at all the trouble and hurry this
work will be!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure I had," said Jessie. "I
wish I had said nothing about it. Grace
can't bear to hear of anything going that
she has not got."</p>

<p>"Any way," said Mrs. Hollis, "you
shall not be put upon, Jessie, after all
your work at Miss Lee's. You shall not
be made to sit at your needle all the evening.
It is not good for your health, and
so I shall tell Grace."</p>

<p>Jessie thanked her mother, but had
little hope that she would be able to hold
out against one so determined as her
sister. Neither mother nor daughter
would have broken her heart if Grace's
application had come too late, but no such
thing! It had been dark about an hour
when she was driven up to the door in a
dog-cart, out of which huge rolls of linen
were lifted, enough, as it seemed, to stock
the shop. Grace shook hands with the
smart groom who had driven her, thanked
him, and came in in high spirits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Robson had been most gracious!
She said she had feared being obliged
to put up with mere warehouse work, and
that she could not bear; but country
people were so lazy and disobliging. It
was not what she was used to.</p>

<p>Grace had been taken up into the young
lady's own room, and oh! what she had
to tell about tall cheval glasses, and ivory-backed
brushes, and rose-coloured curtains,
and marble-topped washhand-stands, and
a bed and wardrobe of inlaid wood, with
beautiful birds and flowers, and gold-topped
bottles and boxes, and downy chairs!
The description was enough to last a week,
and indeed it did, for fresh details came
out continually. It almost made Jessie
jealous for Miss Manners. Once when
she had been caught in a sudden shower
and arrived wet through she had been
taken up to Miss Manners's bed-room to
take off her boots and put on slippers.</p>

<p>And there was only a plain little iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
bed, uncurtained, and the floor was bare
except for rugs at the hearth and bed-side,
and the furniture was nothing but
white dimity. The chimney ornaments and
the washhand-stand looked like those in a
nursery&mdash;as indeed they well might, for
they had belonged to Miss Dora nearly all
her life; they all had stories belonging to
them, were keepsakes from dear friends,
and she would not have given one, no,
not the shell cat with an ear off, nor the
little picture made of coloured sand, for
Miss Robson's finest gilded box, unless
indeed that had come in the same way.</p>

<p>And there were two prints on the walls,
very grave and beautiful, which made
one feel like being in Church, and so did
the illuminated texts, though all were not
equally well done, some being painted by
her little nieces. Jessie had a feeling in
her mind that there was something finer
and nobler in not making one's own nest
so very splendid and luxurious, but she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
knew Grace would laugh at the notion, so
she said nothing of the difference, while
her mother said, "Dear, dear!" and
"Think of that!" at each new bit of
magnificence she heard of.</p>

<p>Grace had her patterns and materials,
and the fineness of them, and beauty of
the lace provided for the trimming, were
quite delightful to look at.</p>

<p>The payment was to be very handsome,
and Grace felt secure of carrying through
the work in time, with the help of her
mother and sister.</p>

<p>"You shall have your share, Jessie," she
said. "See, here are some sweet French
cambric handkerchiefs to be marked in
embroidery. 'I have a sister who can
embroider beautifully,' says I, and they
just jumped at it. 'Nina' is the name
to be worked in the corners."</p>

<p>"Oh, I like embroidery," cried Jessie.
"Thank you, Grace."</p>

<p>"There's six dozen," said Grace,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
"and you'll be able to do one a day.
Four pence a letter. Why it will be
quite a little fortune to you," said Grace,
overpowered with her own generosity;
and Jessie on her side thought of the
many things 4<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> would do for her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>STITCH, STITCH, STITCH.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> must be confessed that Mrs. Hollis
and Jessie had a hard time of it while
those wedding clothes were being
made!</p>

<p>There was no time for anything,
certainly not for cooking. They ate the
cold Sunday joint as long as it lasted, and
lived the rest of the week on bread and
cheese, and Australian meat now and
then.</p>

<p>Grace got up before four every morning,
and there was not much peace in
bed for any one after that.</p>

<p>Of course the shop had to be minded,
and that Mrs. Hollis did, but she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
expected to be at her needle at every
spare moment; and for the needful cleaning
and rougher work, Grace got a woman
for a couple of hours who came cheap,
because she did not bear a very good
character. Mrs. Hollis did not much like
having her about, but, as Grace said, one
or other of them always had an eye upon
her, and she was only there for a couple
of hours in the morning.</p>

<p>It was lucky kettles could boil themselves,
or there might not even have
been tea, and as to going to Mrs.
Somers's working parties, Grace declared
it to be impossible.</p>

<p>"I've got something else to do," she
said, decidedly. "The lady can't expect
me to stand in my own light."</p>

<p>And when she saw Jessie on Friday
evening put away her work and fetch her
hat and books, she cried out against such
idling, and said it must be given up.</p>

<p>"No," said Jessie. "I can't give up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
my Church and my preparation with Miss
Manners."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You see I've given up my
working party."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I can't give up mine," said
Jessie. "Oh, Grace, we thought so much
about trying to do what we could."</p>

<p>"And so I am!" said Grace. "No
one can say I am not doing my duty to
my family, and that's better than throwing
away my time on a lot of beggarly
folk that don't deserve nothing. And
you ought to know better, Jessie."</p>

<p>"I must have my lesson prepared,"
said she in return.</p>

<p>"As if you couldn't teach that there
Bell girl without going to read with Miss
Manners first! You'll never have those
handkerchiefs done!"</p>

<p>"I did two letters extra this morning,"
said Jessie.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's very fine, but if you get
one of your headaches&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The sound of that word alarmed Mrs.
Hollis. Jessie had had a bad illness
about a year ago, and the mother could
not part with her anxiety about her.
In she came, with the tea-cup she was
washing in her hand.</p>

<p>"Has Jessie got a headache?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh no, mother, thank you. Grace
is only putting a case."</p>

<p>"Yes; I am asking her what she thinks
will become of the work if she is to go
and take her pleasure whenever she likes.
She talks of working extra; but supposing
she had a headache, she'd be sorry
she had thrown away her time."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," said Mrs. Hollis; "'tis
the very way to make her have a headache
to keep her poor nose to the grindstone.
The doctor, he says to me,
'She've had a shock, and she'll require
care, and not to be overstrained.' And
I tell you, Grace, I won't have Jessie put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
upon, and kept muzzing over her needle
like a blackamoor slave, without a taste
of fresh air. So run away, Jessie, and
get your walk."</p>

<p>"Thank you, mother."</p>

<p>And Jessie, who did not feel bound to
obey her sister, ran lightly off, hoping
poor mother would not be very fiercely
talked at by Grace. She herself was clear
that work undertaken for God's sake
should not be dropped when one's own
gain began to clash with it; while Grace,
who had always been held up as the
model, helpful good daughter, plainly
thought, "working for one's family," and
securing something extra, was such a
reason as to make it a sort of duty to
throw over all she had taken up under
the spur of that sermon in the spring.
Jessie had no headache, but she was
weary, vexed, and teased, and</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Stitch, stitch, stitch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Seam and gusset and band,"</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>rang in her ears, so that she specially felt
rested and soothed by the calm and quiet
of Miss Manners's pretty room, with the
open windows and the scent of flowers
coming in from the garden.</div>

<p>The subject was next Sunday's Gospel,
about the Great Supper and the excuse-making
guests. Miss Manners read out part
of Archbishop Trench's comment on the
Parable before she talked to the teachers
about what they were to say to their
classes; and Jessie felt deeply that to let
herself be engrossed by this undertaking,
so as to allow no time for her religious
duties, would be only too like the guests
who went "one to his farm, and another
to his merchandise." She was advised to
make it a lesson to her class against false
or insufficient excuses, such as saying
they were late at school because mother
wanted them to take a message, when
they had dawdled all the way instead of
hastening to school. Miss Manners lent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the volume of Miss Edgeworth's <i>Rosamond</i>
to Jessie, to read the chapter on Excuses
to her girls, so as to bring home the lesson,
though she was to carry it higher, and
put them in mind that if they put their
duties aside for these little things now,
they would be learning to forget their
Heavenly Master for earthly matters, and
would never taste of His supper.</p>

<p>It made Jessie doubly and trebly determined
that she would not take a lie-a-bed
on Sunday morning to make up for
loss of rest before, and thus miss the early
Celebration on her monthly Sunday. Indeed,
she felt drawn to come oftener, if it
would not be presuming.</p>

<p>She came home from Church in the
summer twilight, when even Grace could
not work, and was standing a moment at
the door before lighting the lamp.</p>

<p>"Well, miss, I hope you have wasted
enough daylight," she said.</p>

<p>"I hope it wasn't quite wasted," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Jessie, cheerfully. "I shall work ever
so much quicker for the rest I have
had."</p>

<p>And she was as good as her word, and
spent an hour in her pleasant embroidery
of the pretty white letters of the name
which she really delighted in doing, only
she would have liked a fresh pattern instead
of making all the seventy-two Ninas
exactly alike.</p>

<p>She was at work before half-past six
the next day, and had three more letters
done before it was time to go to Miss
Lee's, where it was a busy day of finishing
work; and when at three o'clock the last
stitch was put to the dress that had been
made out of Mrs. Drew's cambric, Miss
Lee asked Jessie to carry it home, suspecting
that the walk would be good for
her.</p>

<p>It was rather hot, but Jessie did enjoy
the lanes, with their flowery banks, and
the sweet smells of the hay, and she felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
much brightened and refreshed. When
she came near the house, she saw some
one sitting in a basket-chair in the porch,
and knew that it was Miss Needwood,
a poor, sickly orphan relation of Mrs.
Drew's, who was always trying situations
as nursery governess, or reader, or the
like, and leaving them because her health
would not serve; and then she had no
home to go to but Chalk-pit Farm. She
was not so much above the Hollises as
the farmer's own family, and was always
friendly with them. She came to meet
Jessie, shook hands with her, and explained
that Mrs. Drew had been summoned
to speak about some poultry, but
would return in a moment if Miss Hollis
would sit down.</p>

<p>"Are you stopping here for long?"
asked Jessie.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the poor girl,
sadly; "I hoped I was settled in a
nice situation; but my asthma was bad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
there, and the lady found it out, and
it made her nervous, so here I am again.
Mr. Drew, he is kind, and says I may
make myself useful with teaching the
children; but oh, dear! I don't know
enough for that."</p>

<p>"I thought you had gone out for a
nursery governess."</p>

<p>"Yes"&mdash;the tears came in her
eyes;&mdash;"but I'll never try again. The
elder young ladies made game of my
French, and said I didn't spell as well
as the little nursery girl. And it was
true, Miss Hollis. I tried being a sewing-maid
last, though Mrs. Drew didn't want
folk to know it; but, you see, I hadn't
health for that. They are very good
here, and will keep me; but I am nothing
but a burthen. If I could but hear of
something to do&mdash;if only to keep me in
clothes. I can do fancy-work, if I could
get any."</p>

<p>"Can you embroider?" asked Jessie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Needwood took out her pocket-handkerchief,
where her initials, H. N.,
were beautifully worked. Jessie had
admired her own work, but this was
much better. It was just such an N as
she wanted, and she exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you would be so kind as to lend
me one of those for a pattern, I should
be so much obliged."</p>

<p>"Do you embroider?" asked Miss
Needwood. "I wish you could tell me
if there is any shop at Ellerby or Carchester
that would employ me; I should
be so much happier."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Drew came back, and looked
over the dress which was to be sent to
her daughter at her boarding-school, and
thanked Jessie, and gave her the money
for Miss Lee.</p>

<p>Miss Needwood had fetched the handkerchief,
and Jessie took leave and walked
home, thinking over what shops might
possibly employ the poor girl. What a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
pity she had not those handkerchiefs to
do, and why should she not do some of
them?</p>

<p>Oh, Grace would never consent. Besides,
Jessie had spent her 4<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> in
fancy already on the Offertory, savings
bank, a present for mother, a pair of
spectacles for old Dame Wall, a pretty
new dress and hat for herself. Oh no,
she must work on; it was such pretty
work, and Grace would scorn her so if
she gave up any part of it.</p>

<p>Jessie came home to find Mrs. Hollis
in all the hard work and worry of a
Saturday evening, alone in the shop, with
people waiting and getting cross. She
had to hasten behind the counter and
help as fast as she could. It was well
that the Lees had given her a cup of tea
when she brought in the money, for there
was no quiet for more than an hour, and
then the fire was found to have gone
out while Grace was putting in gathers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Moreover, Jessie saw, with dismay, that
the beefsteak-pie, which was to serve for
the morrow, was not even made.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll do that to-morrow morning,"
said Grace.</p>

<p>And when Jessie proceeded to tack in
her clean collar and cuffs, Grace called
out, raising her hot face from her work,
that they might be pinned in on Sunday
morning; it was only waste of time to
do so now.</p>

<p>"I don't think that is using Sunday
quite well," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"Well, I never heard there was any
harm in sticking in a pin of a Sunday!
Come, sit down, do, and don't keep
fiddling about. You'll be behind with
those handkerchiefs. Here, mother, you
can finish this seam before dark."</p>

<p>"The place is in such a caddle," said
poor Mrs. Hollis, looking ruefully round
at her kitchen, which certainly did not
wear at all its usual Saturday evening's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
aspect. "That Jenny Simkins, she do
so stabble in and out, she only wants
some one to clean after her."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'll see to that," said Grace,
"when it gets too dark for work. One
must put up with a little for such a
chance as this."</p>

<p>Jessie felt that her poor mother was
putting up with more than a little, as she
saw her sit down with a sigh and try to
thread her needle by the window. Jessie
went across and did it for her, and put
back the muslin blind so as to let in
more light; then sat down to finish the
"na" of her sixth Nina, rather wearily,
and with an uncomfortable thought that
Miss Needwood's satin-stitch looked better
than her own.</p>

<p>Little "n" was done before the twilight
tidying, which did not amount to
much, for Grace soon lighted the lamp;
but Jessie, in putting up the shop shutters,
made the arm, which had once been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
crushed, tremble so much that she could
not work without pricking her finger,
and Mrs. Hollis really could not see.
So Grace let them both go to bed, and
Jessie half waked to hear her bustling
about, and coming up herself just after
the clock struck twelve. She would not
have set a stitch on any account after that!</p>

<p>Jessie was up early enough to light the
fire, and set out the breakfast things, and
put on the kettle, while both her mother
and Grace were still in bed. She had a
peaceful, happy time then, but otherwise
she had never known such an uncomfortable
Sunday.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollis was down when she came
back, but was fretting over the very large
bit that had gone out of the cheese.
Jessie thought they had eaten it for want
of meat; her mother suspected Jenny
Simkins. Then she had not been
allowed time to copy out her accounts
into the book, and there had been a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
great puzzle between a three and a five
on the slate last night, which seemed
to have been worrying her all night in
her dreams; and the uncleaned look of
the house vexed her. She was tired and
not like herself, and Jessie only left her
for school and church on hearing Grace's
step on the stairs.</p>

<p>At school she could forget all about it in
the interest of teaching, but the worry
returned when her mother's place was
empty at the beginning of the service;
and when Mrs. Hollis did come posting
in at the end of the <i>Venite</i>, she was so
hot and panting that she had to sit
down and fan herself with her pocket-handkerchief
all through the Psalms, and
Jessie even feared she might be going
to faint.</p>

<p>"Oh dear," Mrs. Hollis mourned, when
they came out of church, "she had never
been so upset before, but she had been
so put about to get off, with none of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
things ready, and she was <i>that</i> tired and
sleepy she had not heard a word of the
sermon. Grace really had undertaken too
much. The house was in such a mess
there was no sitting down quiet and
respectable, and there was threepence in
the till that would not be accounted for,
and she was sure that the cheese was
going too fast." She fretted all the way
home, and Jessie could not comfort her,
by promising to look over the accounts
the first thing on Monday.</p>

<p>However, on coming home they found
the whole house tidied, dinner laid, the
pie made and just ready to come out of
the Dutch oven, and the accounts balanced
and written out fairly. Grace was
just finishing the arraying herself in full
Sunday trim outside, but how was it with
the inner Sunday raiment of her heart?</p>

<p>She did nothing but talk about "seam
and gusset and band," and how fast she
was getting on, and how good the linen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was, and what sort was the best, till
Jessie thought she might almost as well
have been sewing all day as with her
thoughts running on nothing else.</p>

<p>When Jessie went to afternoon school,
both Mrs. Hollis and Grace were so tired
that the one went to sleep in her chair,
and the other on her bed; and thus
Jessie found them on her return.</p>

<p>Poor mother! how weary and worn
her face looked after this week of worry.
The sight of it settled Jessie's mind. She
went up softly to take off her things, and
as she was doing so, Grace awoke. Jessie
went up to her and showed her Miss
Needwood's cipher.</p>

<p>"Bless me! whose is that? It is real
genteel," said Grace.</p>

<p>"It is Miss Needwood's at Chalk-pit
Farm."</p>

<p>"What! that poor helpless thing that
never can keep a situation! Did you get
it for a pattern, Jessie?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Jessie; "she lent it to
me."</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," said Grace, examining
it minutely. "You ought to work
like that, Jessie."</p>

<p>"I would if I could," said Jessie, "and
I mean to try; but, Grace, I shall only
finish this first dozen. I shall send the
other five dozen to Bessie Needwood.
She is in great want of work, and will do
them much better than I."</p>

<p>"Well I never!" cried Grace. "I
never thought you'd turn lazy, and give
up what you had undertaken&mdash;when I
had asked for the handkerchiefs on purpose
for you, because I thought a little
pocket money would come in convenient!"</p>

<p>"So it would. It was very kind of
you, Grace; but Miss Needwood will do
them better than I."</p>

<p>"Not than you if you chose to take
the pains and trouble."</p>

<p>"No," said Jessie, "if I don't hurry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
them too quick to try to do those finest
stitches, I sha'n't have time to do them at
all, in these after hours of mine."</p>

<p>"Well, that you should choose to confess
yourself not able to do as well as a
poor dozing thing like that! It's all
laziness."</p>

<p>"No, that it is not," said Jessie, rather
hotly. "I thought if those were off my
hands I could help you, and then mother
need not have any of this work to do, or
be so driven and put about."</p>

<p>"You don't expect to be paid for any
part of mother's work," said Grace, with
some sharpness. "I've got my own use
for that in the business."</p>

<p>"No, I don't!" and Jessie went suddenly
off in a little bit of temper for
which she was sorry afterwards, wishing
she had said that her real reason&mdash;besides
the helping Miss Needwood&mdash;was the
hope to save her mother from being
over driven, and not to have another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Sunday so cumbered with worldly
matters.</p>

<p>Grace came down to tea grumbling,
and appealing to her mother about
Jessie's laziness; and Mrs. Hollis, for
whose sake the girl had resigned five-sixths
of her hoped-for gain, was inclined
to be vexed at any of the work
going out of the family, or her Jessie
allowing herself to be beaten.</p>

<p>It was very vexatious, and Jessie was
glad when Uncle Andrew dropped in to
tea, and to change the current of their
thoughts.</p>

<p>She was to stay at home to guard the
house while the others went to evensong,
and this gave her the quiet opportunity
of packing up five dozen handkerchiefs,
and writing a note to send with them to
Bessie Needwood the first thing in the
morning, by any child who came early to
the shop.</p>

<p>Then she felt much more at ease, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was able to have a comfortable study of
her next Sunday's Gospel and its references,
in case she should be too busy on
the week days; and so she was peaceful
and refreshed, and able to enjoy a quiet
little wander in the twilight garden with
her hymn-book. This lasted till the
others came home, brim full of reports
they had picked up about the splendour
of the coming wedding. The gentleman,
Mr. Holdaway, was staying at Newcorn
Park, and, what was more, he had sent
his horses and grooms down to the
Manners Arms, because the stables at the
Chequers were not well kept.</p>

<p>The head groom had actually been at
Church, and looked quite the gentleman,
though to be sure he did stare about
wonderfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollis shook her head, and said
no good came of that sort of folk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>WANDERING EYES.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I assure</span> you he said he had never
seen a place with more pretty young
ladies in it."</p>

<p>"Who?" said Jessie, coming suddenly
into the light closet of the work-room,
where Florence Cray was taking off
her hat, and Amy Lee seemed to be
helping her.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Wingfield, Mr. Holdaway's
head groom, who has come over with
another man and a boy, and three of the
loveliest horses you ever did see."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I heard," said Jessie; "and
how he stared about at Church! He ought
to be ashamed of himself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! that's what Grace says, of course,"
said Florence; "and she's a regular old
maid. She needn't fear that he'll stare
at her."</p>

<p>Wherewith both Florence and Amy
giggled, and before Jessie's hot answer
was out of her mouth, one of the aunts
called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Girls, girls, what are you doing?
No gossiping there."</p>

<p>Florence came out looking cross, and
observing in a marked manner that Miss
Fuller, at Ellerby, always spoke of her
young ladies.</p>

<p>"I like using right names," said Aunt
Rose in her decided voice.</p>

<p>Florence was silenced for the time, but
at the dinner hour she contrived to get
Amy alone. Jessie was in haste to get
home to see if there were an answer from
Miss Needwood, and also to try to get
enough sewing done to pacify Grace, and
purchase a little leisure for her mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
And Florence, instead of going home,
stood with Amy, who had sauntered into
the garden to refresh herself and gather
some parsley.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Amy, he was quite
struck. He said yours was such a style
that he would hardly believe me when I
said you belonged to Mr. Lee, the baker.
It was the refinement, he said."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Florence; don't," said
Amy, blushing as crimson as the rose
she tried to gather.</p>

<p>"I'm not talking nonsense; I never
did see a poor man so smitten."</p>

<p>"Now, Florence, you shouldn't say
such things; father and aunts would not
like it. I shall go in."</p>

<p>"Fathers and aunts are all alike; they
never do like such things. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>However, Amy was safe indoors by
this time, all in a glow, very much
ashamed that such things should have
been said to her, and yet not a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
fluttered and pleased. She had been
most carefully brought up and watched
over, and she had come to the age of
sixteen without hearing more about herself
than that a young lady, who once
came into the school with Miss Agnes
Manners, said something that sounded
like lovely, and was speedily hushed up
and silenced.</p>

<p>All the other girls thought the young
lady meant Henrietta Coles, who was
tall, with bright dark eyes, red cheeks,
and black hair, under a round comb; but
Amy had always been sure that the
speaker's eyes were upon her, though she
had been ashamed of the belief, and
indeed had nearly forgotten all about it,
till it was stirred up by Florence's talk.</p>

<p>She went up to her room to smooth
her hair before dinner. Yes, it was very
nice light-brown hair, with a golden shine;
and her eyes were very clear and blue,
and her skin very white, with a rosy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
flush; and her nose was straight, and the
shape was a pretty delicate one. Amy
really did think Mr. Wingfield was right,
and had better taste than the people who
thought her a poor washy, peaky thing,
as she had more than once heard herself
called.</p>

<p>She put her head on one side, smirked
a little, half shut her eyes, and studied
herself in different positions, till she heard
one of her aunts on the stairs; and then,
in a desperate fright lest she should be
caught, she darted out so fast as to run
against Aunt Charlotte coming up stairs
with a basket of clean linen from the
wash. There were three pairs of stockings
rolled up on the top, and these tumbled
out, and one pair went hop, hop, from
step to step all the way down stairs, just
as Father was coming in, and he caught
it up and threw it like a ball straight up
at his sister.</p>

<p>The confusion drove the nonsense out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of Amy's head for the present. She ate
her dinner, and then went off as usual
for her visit to little Edwin Smithers,
carrying him only a few strawberries, as
she knew he always had soup from the
Hall on a Monday.</p>

<p>For Edwin had not died. He had
rather grown better than worse, and if
the truth must be told, Amy had begun
to get a little tired of him. He was not
a quick child, and in this hot weather he
often failed to do the sums or learn the
verses that Amy set him.</p>

<p>To-day he was nursing a great piece
of stick-liquorice with which he had
painted a dirty spot on the central
face in the picture of the number of the
<i>Chatterbox</i> which she had lent him. She
scolded him for it, and he turned sulky,
and would not try to repeat his hymn,
nor answer any questions, and looked at
his book as if he had never seen one
before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Amy grew angry, told him he was a
naughty boy, and she should not stay
with him nor give him any strawberries;
and off she went, carrying away the
injured <i>Chatterbox</i>, and never bethinking
herself that the hot day and the weariness
of the dull untidy room might not
be the cause of the naughty fit, and
whether it would not have been kinder
and better to try to soothe him out
of it.</p>

<p>But instead of this she paused to hear
Mrs. Rowe declare he was a bad 'un,
with a nasty sulky temper that no one
could do nothing with, and just then she
saw Florence Cray crossing the village
green.</p>

<p>"I've just been to get a little red
pepper at Hollis's," she said, as she put
her arm fondly into Amy's. "Mr. Wingfield
do like something tasty for his
breakfast, and ma is going to do him
some devilled kidneys to-morrow morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
He is quite the gentleman in all his
tastes, you see! I wanted Jessie to walk
back with me, but they are all so terrible
busy over that there wedding order, that
she could not come till the last minute."</p>

<p>"Working all through the dinner
hour!" said Amy. "What a shame!"</p>

<p>"So I say. But that Grace Hollis is a
one! I wouldn't have her for my sister.
Here, come in, Amy, I must just give
mother the pepper."</p>

<p>"No, I can't do that," said Amy,
uneasily, for she knew her father would be
displeased if she went into a public-house;
though as Florence said, "Gracious! You
needn't go near the bar. It's only the
back door! As if I would ask you to
do anything you ought not! But I
suppose our house ain't good enough for
you."</p>

<p>"Oh! don't be angry, Florence dear,
I'll come some day when I've got leave."</p>

<p>"Leave indeed, at your age; but you're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a poor-spirited thing, Amy, to be so kept
down by a couple of old aunts."</p>

<p>Amy was flurried at the displeasure,
and wanted to make it up. "Oh! don't
be offended, Florence. Look here."</p>

<p>"Strawberries! oh my! already!
Thank you," and Florence had soon
swallowed up poor little Edwin's strawberries.</p>

<p>"Wait here one moment then," she
said, "and I'll be back with you in an
instant."</p>

<p>Amy stood under her parasol, trying
to make the most of the small shelter
afforded by Mr. Cray's garden hedge, and
recollecting rather uncomfortably something
she had once been told about the
loitering of the disobedient Prophet
being what brought him into temptation.
But, having promised to wait, she could
not move away, though she had to stay
longer than she liked, especially as the
children were going by to afternoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
school, and some of her own class began
to stare at her.</p>

<p>However, at last Florence came out,
quite excited. "Oh, Amy, if you'll only
wait a minute, you'll see him come
out."</p>

<p>"I can't! I can't! Let us go," cried
Amy, quite shocked and shy.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Poor man, he need never
see you. He is just going to take the
horses up for his master to ride out with
Miss Robson. Such sweet horses! Mr.
Holdaway gave 120 guineas for his.
Think of that, Amy! Here now, come
round the corner of the hedge, and he'll
never see you."</p>

<p>So Amy followed and peeped, very shy
and frightened, like a guilty thing, and
she did see two horses, much more beautiful
than she knew, one ridden by a
common-looking groom, the other by a
very smart, well set-up person, with a
belt round his waist. That was all she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
saw, for they were gone in a flash, and
she was too uncomfortable to see much,
or to do more than hurriedly answer
Florence's exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ain't he quite the gentleman? Bain't
his horses real darlings?" before Jessie's
voice was heard&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, whatever are you two doing
here?"</p>

<p>The two girls both giggled, and each
pushed the other to make her tell, and
Florence laughed out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, 'twas Amy wanted to see Mr.
Wingfield pass by."</p>

<p>"No, 'twasn't. 'Twas you," said Amy.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should get into
a corner about it," said Jessie, rather
gravely. "I've just met him straight
upon the road, horses and all."</p>

<p>"O yes, <i>you</i>!" said Florence.</p>

<p>"Well, why not me?"</p>

<p>"O, you know, you'll soon be an old
maid like your sister."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Jessie had not grown so wise as not to
be nettled at this silly impertinent speech,
but she was much more vexed to see that
Florence was teaching Amy her own
follies&mdash;Amy, who had always seemed
like a pure little innocent wild rose-bud
in its modest green leaves. So she
answered, rather shortly&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you mean that I don't want to be
right down ridiculous, I hope I am an
old maid."</p>

<p>This seemed to be very funny, for
Florence went off in fits of laughing,
and kept shouldering Amy to make her
see the joke, but Amy had by this time
grown ashamed and frightened and only
answered, "Don't."</p>

<p>So the three girls went in together, and
no one took any special notice of Amy's hot
face and uncomfortable gestures. It was the
first time since she had been a very little
child that she had shrunk from her aunts'
eyes, or feared that they should ask her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
questions; and the sense that she had
been undeserving of the trust they placed
in her made her very ill at ease, though
the silly girl did not do the only thing
that would have set her right again, and
made her safer for the future.</p>

<p>Jessie meanwhile had forgotten the
little vexation. She had something to
brighten her up in Miss Needwood's little
note.</p>

<p>It was written on pink paper, edged
with blue, as if nothing could be too good
for Jessie; and it said no words could tell
how glad she was, and what a comfort
it was to have this real work to do.
"It is really like a ray of hope in the
darkness," said poor Bessie, in her little
thin weak writing, with a very hard steel
pen.</p>

<p>But that note warmed up Jessie's heart,
although her finger was getting severely
ploughed up with the stitching she had
been doing to save her mother's eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was not to be an inch of machine
work," Mrs. Robson had said, and
the Hollises were people who fulfilled all
they undertook.</p>

<p>But Jessie's hour at home had helped
and freshened her mother, who looked
much less worn and worried than she
had done the day before. Jessie felt she
had done well to send away the handkerchiefs,
and lessen the burthen Grace had
taken upon the family.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>AMY'S VISITS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Nobody</span> could say any great harm of
Florence Cray, or she would not have
been bound to Miss Lee.</p>

<p>But she was one of those silly, vulgar-minded
girls who think life is nothing
without continually chattering either to
young men or about them. She was in no
hurry to be married, for then she knew she
must give up all her lively pastime with
the lads around her. Not that she frequented
the bar, or had anything to do
with the customers&mdash;her mother kept her
carefully from that; but she had plenty
of acquaintance, and to her mind nothing
else was so amusing. She was not pretty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and knew it well enough, but she was
very good-natured, and free from jealousy,
and next to diverting herself with some
youth, she liked nothing so well as teasing
other girls about them.</p>

<p>She considered Amy Lee quite old
enough and pretty enough to have a
young man, and to begin to have some
fun, and she thought all the care taken
of the girl by her father and aunts only
so much stupid old fidget and jealousy,
which it was fun to baffle and elude.
Thus she was a very dangerous companion
for Amy, perhaps more so than a
really worse person, who would have been
more shocking and startling to Amy's
sense of modesty and propriety. It was
such a new sensation altogether to be
always popping about and peeping to
admire the handsome stranger and his
fine horses, and then to whisk giggling
out of the way, in terror lest they had
been seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>It was more amusing than sitting by a
fretful boy, trying to make him read and
say hymns, and though conscience was
half awake, it was easily satisfied. And
then there was the pleasure of being told
that she was admired&mdash;though Amy
would not have liked it as well if she had
guessed that Florence used to amuse herself
on the other hand by telling Mr.
Wingfield how a certain young lady
admired him, and teasing him by declaring
that, "Oh no! she could not tell him
who, she should be nameless. Did he like
best fair or dark?"</p>

<p>So time went on, and the needlework
with it. Grace Hollis's whole brain
seemed to be turning into thread and
cotton, for she was able to think of nothing
else except what she should do
with the money, when she got it; but
she did not scold Jessie, as she had been
inclined to do at first, for giving up the
handkerchiefs, for she had begun to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that without her sister's help there would
have been no chance of finishing, without
overworking her mother, and neglecting
the business of the shop.</p>

<p>Indeed, as it was, when the last week
came there was so much still to be done
that she was obliged to ask Miss Needwood
to come and help, which she was
very glad to do, when she had finished
the handkerchiefs most delicately and
beautifully.</p>

<p>Jessie gave all the time she could. She
was glad to have something to think
about, for Miss Manners was from home,
so there were no readings before the Sundays;
and her sharp eyes could not help
seeing that there was something underhand
going on between Amy and Florence&mdash;where
she did not know whether to
interfere or not.</p>

<p>She had seen Amy and Florence come
hastily round the corner of the lane,
which had a stile into a large shady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
path field at the back of Mrs. Smithers's
cottage, and Mr. Wingfield hovering
about. It did not look well&mdash;and indeed
what she would have thought nothing of
in such a girl as Florence was a very
different thing in Amy. Then stories
that she disliked were afloat about the
man. He was said to be teaching the
young men at the Manners Arms new
gambling games, and to be putting them
up to bet on race-horses; and once she
heard a very unpleasant laugh about
very good, closely-kept girls being as
ready to carry on as other folk.</p>

<p>Once when she asked Amy after little
Edwin Smithers, the answer was rather
cross. "Oh! just as usual. He is the
most tiresome fractious child I ever saw!"</p>

<p>"Children are often like that when
they are going to be worse," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"Well," returned Amy, "I've always
heard that children are most fretty and
fussy when they are getting better."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I hope he is better."</p>

<p>"O dear yes, of course he is, or he
would not be here now," said Amy,
impatiently, and getting very red.</p>

<p>"How does he get on with his
reading?"</p>

<p>"There never was such a one for questions
as you, Jessie!" cried Amy, getting
quite cross.</p>

<p>And as Jessie knew curiosity to be her
failing, and was really trying to break
herself of it, she was silenced.</p>

<p>No doubt Amy was angered because
her conscience was very far from being
easy, though she never failed to pop into
the Smithers's cottage every day, sometimes
to bring the little dainties her aunts
provided, sometimes to say a few words
and begin a lesson with Edwin; but her
heart was not in it, the boy would seldom
attend, and often turned away his face
and said "No," or began to cry; whereupon
Amy told him he was very naughty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and marched off, excusing herself by the
fact that the girl Polly was generally in
the house, and seemed to be attending to
him much better than she used to do.</p>

<p>No wonder Amy was in a hurry, for
Florence was waiting for her outside; and
by and by not only Florence.</p>

<p>It began one windy day when Amy's
sunshade flew out of her hand. She ran
after it, as it went dancing along on its
spokes over the village green, jumping
up just as she neared it, and whisking
off just as if it had been alive, or like
one of those gay butterflies and birds in
allegories that lure the little pilgrims out
of the narrow path. Alas! it was only
too much like such a deluder.</p>

<p>For some one came round the corner,
caught the wild sunshade, and restored it
to the owner. She was tittering and
breathless, she blushed all over, and
never raised her eyes while Mr. Wingfield
hoped, in elegant language, that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
had not fatigued herself, and paid a
flattering compliment to the lovely colour
with which exercise had suffused her complexion.
This made her giggle and blush
all the more. She did not know whether
she liked it or not, poor silly child!</p>

<p>She often "wished he would not;" she
was in a dreadful fright whenever it
happened, and yet the day seemed flat
and tiresome and not worth having when
he had not joined her and Florence, and
walked down the path below Hornbeam
Wood, behind Mrs. Smithers's cottage,
with them.</p>

<p>He never said or did anything to
startle her. He saw she was a modest,
well-behaved girl, and he knew how to
treat such a one. He talked chiefly
about the preparations for the wedding,
or made the two simple country girls
stare by wonderful stories of the horses
he had ridden and driven, or by descriptions
of the parks and the theatre. Now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and then he was complimentary, but
Florence told Amy much more of his
admiration than she ever heard herself.
As to letting her father or aunts
know of the acquaintance, Amy was
half afraid, half ashamed. One day she
heard a talk between her father and Mr.
Nowell, the gardener at the Hall, who was
vexed about an under gardener.</p>

<p>"I shall have to speak to the Squire
about him, I am afraid," said Mr. Nowell;
"he don't do his work with half a heart,
and instead of spending his evenings at
the club, or at cricket&mdash;wholesome and
hearty like&mdash;he is always down at Cray's."</p>

<p>"I hear," said Mr. Lee, "the club was
never so badly attended."</p>

<p>"They say it is all along of that there
smart groom, Wingfield, as they call him,
who is all for gambling games, and
putting up our young lads to betting
tricks and the like."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said Mr. Lee, "one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
them idle, good-for-nothing servants
loafing about at a public will do more
harm in a place than you can undo in
a day."</p>

<p>"That's true," added Aunt Rose; "I
can't bear the sight of the fellow lounging
about with his little stick, as if he was
saying to all the place, 'Here I am; it's
just improvement to you all to see how
I switch my legs.'"</p>

<p>"And he stares so!" added Aunt
Charlotte. "Last time Amy and I met
him on the road, I really thought he
would have stared the poor child out of
countenance. I had a great mind to have
spoken to him, and told him to mind his
manners."</p>

<p>"You are too young and too good-looking
to do that sort of thing, Charlotte,"
said her brother, laughing. "May
be 'twas your aunt he looked at, so you
needn't go as red as a turkey-cock, Amy
girl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Me, indeed!" said Charlotte, in hot
indignation. "I should hope I was <i>past</i>
being stared at by a whipper-snapper
monkey like that."</p>

<p>The elders all laughed heartily, and
Mr. Nowell said something about Miss
Charlotte being a fine woman of her time
of life, which made her still more angry,
and set her brother and sister laughing
the more.</p>

<p>Amy squeezed out a weak little giggle,
but she was both angered and frightened.
She could never tell her aunts now.
What would they say? The time of the
wedding was drawing on; Mr. Wingfield
would be going. Little flutters moved
her breast. Would he say any more
before he went, or did she wish it?
Florence said he was dying for her.
Florence thought he was a gentleman
in disguise, like one she had read about
in a novel; but Amy, though she liked
to dream of something sweet and grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
years hence, did not want to be startled
by love-making now, or to have the
dreadful disturbance at home there would
be if this were more than a summer acquaintance.
How would the aunts look,
when they found she had concealed all
this&mdash;she who had never hidden anything
from them before?</p>

<p>And yet she took the stolen pleasure
in trembling every day, and tried to
believe Florence when she said there was
no harm in it, that every one did so,
and that young people must be young!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>AWKWARD MEETINGS.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, to be sure, who would have
thought of such a treat! This is a
pleasure indeed! Rose, Rose, whom do
you think we have here?"</p>

<p>"How natural it all do look to be sure.
There, Ambrose, there's the very rose tree
I have so often told you of."</p>

<p>"Why, mother has described it all so
well, I could have found my way blindfold."</p>

<p>The speaker was a tall, fair-faced young
man, looking, in Charlotte Lee's eyes, like
one of the young gentlemen from the
university, but with something grave and
deep about his face, and by him stood
his little mother in the neatest of black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
silk dresses, with something sweet and
childlike about her face still, though there
were some middle-aged lines in it. She
had once been the Amy Lee of Langley.
She had married a schoolmaster, Mr.
Cuthbert, and this was their only son.
He had distinguished himself in all his
examinations, and at the same time had
shown so deep an interest in missions to
the heathen, and had done so much to
make the boys of the school care for
them, that when there was a question of
choosing a lad as a missionary student,
whose expenses would be paid by subscriptions
of the clergy in the diocese,
at the great college of St. Augustine's
at Canterbury, the vicar of his parish
had three years ago proposed Ambrose
Cuthbert as the fittest youth he knew. He
had just finished his terms at the college,
and was on his way home before going
out to Rupertsland, having met his mother
at the house of his father's brother in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
London. They had found out that an
excursion train would enable them to run
down to Langley and spend a few hours
there; and Mrs. Cuthbert, who had always
said her son must not leave England without
having seen her old home, her brother
and sisters, was delighted with the opportunity,
and here they were, the brother and
the three sisters all together, hardly knowing
what they said in their eager joy.</p>

<p>"And my little Amy, where is she?
You have not seen your namesake, Amy,"
said the father, who had come in bare
armed and floury.</p>

<p>"She is not come back yet from poor
little Teddy's," said Aunt Rose. "The
child goes to teach, and see to, a poor little
sick lad in a cottage every day, Amy.
We like her to do such things," she
added, pleased that her sister should see
that their child was likewise something
superior in goodness. "Ah! is it you,
Jessie? This is Clemmy Fielding's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
daughter, Amy. Did you see our Amy
as you came along, Jessie?"</p>

<p>"I will run back and call her," said
Jessie, who had seen the top of Amy's
sunshade over the hedge, and in good-natured
sympathy wanted to spare all the
shock of discovery.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Miss Rose, "thank you
all the same, Jessie, but if you would not
mind sitting down to the machine, I
would walk out that way with my sister,
just while my brother is finishing his
batch of bread, and you are getting ready
a bit of something to eat, Charlotte. I
know, Amy, you would like just to look
round the hill, and see where the squire's
new cottages lie. Wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Jessie saw there was no help for it.
Mrs. Cuthbert was delighted to go and
to show her son her old haunts; but first
she spoke very kindly to Jessie, and
inquired for her mother, saying she remembered
her well; and on her side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Jessie recollected that her mother always
said she owed more to Mrs. Cuthbert's
kindness when she was a little girl than
to any one else.</p>

<p>So off set the two elder sisters and the
pleasant looking young man together.
Amy always was late, and Jessie felt one
hope, that they might meet the two
girls coming in together. Yet, as she
whirred her machine, she reflected that
after all it might be best for Amy in the
end that all this folly and concealment
should be put a stop to.</p>

<p>Out they went, talking; Mrs. Cuthbert
asking questions, and pointing everything
out to her son, and Aunt Rose delighted
to answer.</p>

<p>"We do not hurry the maid," said
Aunt Rose, as they drew near. "You see
it is such a blessing to that poor little
afflicted child to have her with him."</p>

<p>Perhaps Rose Lee, who had had her
dreams and fancies like other people, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
thinking of the tales where some one
looks in at the window and sees the good
young person bending over the sufferer's
couch, and reading good books to him;
but it was certainly not Amy whom she
saw as the door stood open. There was
the little boy on the old couch under the
window, moaning a little, but it was his
sister who was standing by him with a
cup of something, coaxing him with
"Now Teddy, do be a good boy, and
drink it, do'ee now."</p>

<p>"Why, Polly," said Aunt Rose, "are
you here?"</p>

<p>"Please, Miss Lee," said Polly, in
a high squeaky voice of self-defence,
"Our Ted is so bad, I couldn't go to
school, not this afternoon."</p>

<p>"And where's Miss Amy? Not gone
for the doctor?" asked Rose, seeing indeed
that the poor child looked very ill.</p>

<p>"No, miss," said Polly. "Teacher Amy
don't come now for more than a minute."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is she then?" asked Rose, to
whom the world seemed whirling round;
while Ambrose Cuthbert stood at the
door, and his mother was feeling the poor
child's hands, and looking with dismay
at the grease gathering on the half cold
broth with which his sister had been
trying to feed him.</p>

<p>But Polly's answer was quite ready&mdash;"Down
the mead along with that there
Wingfield and Cray's gal."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Rose, severely, for the
girl's tone had that sort of pert simplicity,
or simple pertness, that children can put
on when they know they are giving unpleasant
information, but will not seem
to understand it.</p>

<p>"With Mr. Wingfield, the gentleman's
groom up at the Arms," said she. "He
be her young man."</p>

<p>Ambrose Cuthbert turned his head
outwards to hide a smile. Rose said
hotly, "Hold your tongue, child! don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
be saucy! Come, Amy, here is some
mistake."</p>

<p>"Stay, Rose," said Mrs. Cuthbert, "the
child is really very ill. Has he a mother?
Something ought to be done."</p>

<p>Rose did not feel as if she could care
for the boy at such a moment, and just
then old Mrs. Rowe, brought by the sound
of voices, came in by the back door.</p>

<p>"Ay! Rose Lee," she said. "If you
wants to know where your fine niece is,
just look here. I never knew no good
come of bringing up young folks to be
better than their neighbours, going about
a visiting as if they was ladies."</p>

<p>Rose had reached the back garden, and
over the broken-down little gate she saw&mdash;in
the path shaded by the coppice&mdash;three
figures whom she knew only too
well, sauntering towards the stile leading
into the lane.</p>

<p>She felt quite giddy, as she called out
sharply, "Amy Lee!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a great start. The three stood
still, and looked about as if to see where
the voice came from. Rose, recollecting
the old woman's malicious eyes, got over
the stile and came towards them. They
had seen her by this time; she perceived
that they were whispering; then the man
retreated, and Florence and Amy came
towards her, Florence holding Amy's
hand, and pushing to the front.</p>

<p>"Miss Lee," she said, "we weren't
doing no harm. Only taking a walk
before coming in."</p>

<p>"Florence Cray," returned Miss Lee,
"I don't want to have anything to say to
you. If you have been teaching Amy to
deceive her father and me, so much
the worse. You need not come to work
this afternoon. My sister, Mrs. Cuthbert,
is come to see us, so I shall not
require you. Come here, Amy."</p>

<p>"You'll not be hard on her, Miss Lee,"
entreated good-natured Florence, feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Amy's fingers cling to her. "I do assure
you there's been nothing no one could
except against. It's been all most
prudent and proper all along."</p>

<p>"I said I don't wish to hear nothing
from you," said Rose. "If you call it
prudent and proper to be walking with
young men, when she is trusted to read
to a sick child, I don't know what I shall
hear next. Come here, Amy; come home
with me."</p>

<p>"Indeed, aunt," sobbed Amy, "I've
been in every day to see him."</p>

<p>"Come home now, Amy," said her
aunt; "I can't talk to you now! No,
don't cry&mdash;don't speak! I won't have
you making yourself a show to the whole
place any more than you have done
already. That you should have deceived
us so!" she sighed to herself. She was
taking Amy in, not by the garden, but
round the corner of the lane, to give a little
more time for her to recover herself, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
also to avoid facing Mrs. Rowe's eager
eyes.</p>

<p>"Please don't tell father," once sighed
Amy.</p>

<p>"Do you think I am going to be as
deceitful as yourself?" was all the answer
she got.</p>

<p>Amy's was a meek nature, and she
knew she had been doing very wrong, so
she uttered no more entreaties; indeed,
she was in such a trembling, choking
state, that her aunt had to wait, and walk
slowly, while the girl tried to control herself
enough to appear respectably&mdash;in a
little lurking hope that perhaps Aunt
Rose would be better than her word, and
at least not tell Aunt Amy, her godmother,
or Cousin Ambrose. She, who
had been always reckoned so good a girl,
and had never been in disgrace before!
That it should have happened at such a
time!</p>

<p>And when the garden gate was opened,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
there was a further shock. More people
were in the house! Miss Manners, who
had come home the night before, had
come to inquire for little Edwin, and
there was a buzz of voices, as she and
Mrs. Cuthbert had most joyfully greeted
one another.</p>

<p>Miss Manners was delighted to see the
young missionary, and the only drawback
was that poor little Edwin was evidently
so much worse. He had been gradually
growing worse and weaker for the last
ten days or a fortnight, Polly and Mrs.
Rowe said, and his mother had sad nights
with him; but the parish doctor had said
it was only feverishness caused by the
heat, when he saw the boy last week, and
did not seem to think it of consequence.
The family depended on the mother's
work, and in hay-making time she could
not stay at home. Mr. Somers was
gone from home, so was Miss Manners,
and no one had thought much about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
poor child; but he had become so much
worse in the course of the morning, that
it was plain that his mother and the
doctor must both be sent for without loss
of time.</p>

<p>Miss Manners came out into the garden
with Mrs. Cuthbert, and as the aunt and
niece came up, said she would find the
messenger.</p>

<p>"Had not you thought him so well,
Amy?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am!" exclaimed Aunt Rose,
always an outspoken person, "that's the
worst trouble of all! Who would have
thought this sly deceitful child could
have made as if she was sitting all the
time with that poor boy, while she was
just walking all the time with that good-for-nothing
groom up at the Arms. How
I shall tell her poor father, I don't know.
It will be enough to break his heart!"</p>

<p>"It was all Florence Cray!" sobbed
Amy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Miss Manners, "of course
her father must know about it; but since
Amy the elder is only to be here three or
four hours, don't you think it would be
better not to spoil her visit for him?
You can have it out in the evening, you
know; but it would be a great pity to
give him such a shock at once. Don't
you think so, Amy?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do, ma'am," said Mrs.
Cuthbert; "I am afraid the poor girl
may have been to blame, but it will not
be the worse for her to wait a little
while, and my brother would be so much
taken up with the matter, that I am
afraid my Ambrose would never know
his uncle as I should like."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it will all be spoilt to me,
any way," said poor Aunt Rose, half
choked.</p>

<p>"But you will bear the burthen alone,
for your brother's sake and Charlotte's,"
said Miss Manners, cheerfully; "besides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
you have your own dear old Amy to help
you to bear it, and that is like old times."</p>

<p>This comforted Rose a good deal. Miss
Dora&mdash;as she and her sister Amy still
called her&mdash;said she would not say good-bye,
she would look in before the Cuthberts
went, and say how the child was.</p>

<p>The younger Amy was glad at first
of the respite, but altogether it was the
most dreadful day she ever spent. There
was her father in his Sunday best coming
out to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'neet'">meet</ins> them, wondering what had
made them stay so long. Mrs. Cuthbert
answered, to save Aunt Rose, that they
had found the child much worse, and
that Miss Manners had come in. This
satisfied him, and they went in to the
meal Aunt Charlotte had prepared&mdash;a
very late luncheon, or early and solid
tea, whichever it might be called&mdash;in
the parlour, with the best china, and
everything as nice as possible.</p>

<p>Really Amy felt as if it would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
less dreadful to have been locked up in
her room, or sitting sewing with Jessie
in the workroom, than sitting up in the
parlour with the rest, and hearing her
father show his pride in her, making her
fetch her prize for the religious examination,
and talking of her almost as if he
wanted to compare her with Aunt Amy's
missionary son.</p>

<p>And then when Ambrose Cuthbert was
questioned about his plans, and told in a
very modest quiet way where he was to
go, and the work he was to do under a
missionary to the Red Indians, Amy saw
more and more how foolish she had been.
What was that conceited groom whose
boast was of the horses he had ridden,
and the bets laid on them, compared with
this young man? Which was the gentleman
of the two? And this was her own
first cousin, and she had forfeited the
respect and esteem which he might have
carried out with him! He would only&mdash;in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
those far countries&mdash;think of his
cousin, Amy Lee, as a giddy, deceitful,
hypocritical girl, who had carried on a
flirtation under cover of a good work.</p>

<p>Amy burnt to tell all the excuses she
thought she had, and how she had been
led on, and that it was not so bad as no
doubt Aunt Rose thought; but she must
keep all back. Only at last her father
remarked that his darling was very
silent&mdash;shy, he thought, with her grand
scholarly cousin. He said he should
like them to hear what a pretty voice
she had, and told her to sing one of her
hymns, such as "Abide with us;" but
Amy could not do that. She put her face
in her hands, choked, and began to cry.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Aunt Charlotte; "poor
dear, it has been a great shock to her,
the poor little boy being taken so much
worse."</p>

<p>It was a comfort to every one that
at that moment Miss Manners came in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
through the shop, asking for Jessie
Hollis.</p>

<p>"The poor little boy is very ill," she
said. "The only thing that seems to
soothe him is a bit of a verse that his
sister Mary says her teacher taught
her. That was you&mdash;is it not, Jessie?
Mary can only say half, and we can't
make it out; but she says, 'If teacher
was but here.'"</p>

<p>Of course Miss Lee was ready to spare
Jessie for such a reason, and she folded up
her work while Miss Manners had a little
talk with Mrs. Cuthbert, on the mingled
pain and sweetness of the giving up her
only son to be one of those sent forth
"to sow beside all waters."</p>

<p>"I am so glad he should have seen
you, ma'am, before he leaves us," said his
mother, the tears rising in her quiet eyes.
"I only wish he could have seen Miss
Edith&mdash;Mrs. Howard; for indeed, ma'am,
I always feel that whatever good my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
children have learnt at home, was owing
to the way I was brought up and the
way Miss Edith used to talk to us."</p>

<p>"Nothing will make my sister so happy
as to hear it, Amy," said Miss Manners.
"Somehow it seems to chime in with
what I had ventured to bring as a little
remembrance of your old home for your
son. I had prepared it to send the St.
Augustine's scholar, before I knew I
should see him."</p>

<p>She gave him a beautiful little <i>Christian
Year</i> and <i>Lyra Innocentium</i> in a case
together, and as the book-marker was the
illuminated text&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"In the morning sow thy seed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And in the evening withhold not thine hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For thou knowest not which shall prosper."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Ambrose Cuthbert thanked the lady in
a very nice way, telling her that he should
value her gift much, and that he hoped to
make the poems his companions and often
his guides in his work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>So with a warm pressure of the hands
of both mother and son, Miss Manners
walked away with Jessie.</p>

<p>"I think," she presently said, "some
of your bread on the waters is coming
back to you, Jessie. They say that little
Mary Smithers has been such a comfort
to her little brother, by repeating to him
what she learns on Sundays, and that she
has been so much more good and attentive
to him of late."</p>

<p>"I am sure, ma'am," said Jessie, "I
never thought Mary Smithers seemed to
understand anything."</p>

<p>"We can never judge where the seed
we sow will prosper," said Miss Dora,
thinking within herself of the different
results with Amy and Jessie.</p>

<p>The little boy had been carried up to
the bedroom. Old Mrs. Rowe was there,
and his mother, who was trying to help
him to lie more easily, while he moved
feebly, but restlessly, and still looked at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
little Polly, who was repeating over and
over some verse in which "Shepherd"
was the only word that Miss Manners,
well as she knew the children's tones,
could make out. Jessie, however, knew
it directly, and repeated&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Gracious Saviour, gentle Shepherd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Little ones are dear to Thee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gathered in Thine Arms and carried,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In Thy Bosom may we be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sweetly, fondly, gently tended,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From all want and danger free."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>She could say the whole hymn, but the
child grew restless as soon as she had
passed beyond the first verse. She returned
to it, once, twice, and then Polly
got back what she had partly forgotten
and went on with it, which was evidently
what quieted the boy best. He seemed
too far gone to attend to anything else;
the sense of other words did not reach
his ears, but these evidently gave him
pleasure. The doctor had said he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
dying, and the women thought he would
sleep himself away. There seemed no
more to be done. Polly had her verse
to say to him, and no help seemed
needed; so Miss Manners and Jessie
went down the stairs again, and out
into the garden, Jessie shedding many
tears, but very far from sad ones. When
she could speak, she said that the young
woman in the hospital to whom she owed
so much knew the hymn, and had so
often repeated it, that Jessie had learnt
it. She had used the first verse one
Sunday when teaching the children about
the Good Shepherd, and, having a little
more time than usual, had tried to teach
it to them&mdash;little thinking how she
should thus meet it&mdash;but using it because
she had grown fond of it for the
sake of her friend, and of the new and
higher feelings that were linked with the
first learning of it.</div>

<p>There was a great peace and thankfulness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in her heart at having thus tasted
a sort of first-fruits of her little attempt
at sowing. It was soothing a death-bed!
Might not she well rejoice that she had
persevered, in spite of the temptation of
gain, in not letting her head and heart
be carried away with the fever of work,
but giving the best part of herself to the
task she had undertaken?</p>

<p>Not that Jessie saw or thought that
this had been the case. Yet if she had
let herself be swept away with Grace's
vehement desire to engross all the needlework,
she must have given up her preparation;
she would have been wearied,
hurried, and very likely fretful and impatient.
At any rate, there would not
have been that kindness and earnestness
which leads others to be good far more
than the actual words of teaching.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE RECKONING.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> is a right punishment for our
sinful pride in her," said Aunt Rose, as
she had a few last words alone with her
elder sister.</p>

<p>"Well, Rose," said Mrs. Cuthbert, "I
would not be so very hard on the poor
child. I've been watching her, and I
think, though no doubt she has done
very wrong, it was in a childish sort of
way, and that you won't find there's been
any real love-making or nonsense of that
sort."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, now I find the child could
deceive us so, and act such a part, there's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
nothing I could not believe," said poor
Aunt Rose.</p>

<p>"That is sad enough, but I think you'll
find it the worst, and that she was led
into it by others."</p>

<p>"That Florence Cray!" exclaimed
Rose; "and what to do about her?
How hinder her from spoiling our child,
when she's bound apprentice to me? I
wish I'd never listened to her father!"</p>

<p>Here came Amy herself, sent up to say
that the trap was ready, and her aunt
must not be late for the train. She felt
as if the last protection was gone when
she saw her aunt and cousin driven away
in the conveyance they had hired at
Ellerby.</p>

<p>Girls bred up like Florence Cray would
have thought it all a great fuss about
nothing. First and last Florence had seen
nothing but fun in Amy's cheating her
strait-laced aunts and getting a little
diversion, while they wanted to shut her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
up with a cross child; but Amy had been
bred up to a very different way of looking
at things, and the whole afternoon had
only been setting more fully before her
how she had fallen from what she had
imagined of herself last Lent!</p>

<p>After all, the delay had made it better
for her. Aunt Rose did not tell the
story quite so hotly and violently as it
would have come out in the first shock
of wrath, but it was dreadful enough to
hear her father say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Amy, child, what is this? I never
thought you would go for to do such a
thing."</p>

<p>"You that we had trusted from a
baby," added Aunt Rose.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte said nothing, but her
looks were the worst of all to bear, they
were so gentle and so sorrowful. And
when Amy had sobbed out her story they
told her that she had been so sly that they
did not know how to believe her word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, father! you may believe me. I
never told a story&mdash;no, I never did!"</p>

<p>"And yet you could make as if you
were going day by day to sit with that
poor little chap, only that you might
be tramping about the lanes with that
there scamp!"</p>

<p>It was what he took as the hypocrisy
of the thing that chiefly wounded Mr.
Lee, and when Amy declared she had
always gone into the cottage and spoken
to the boy, she was told, "Much she
could have attended to him, since she had
never seen that the poor child was dying."</p>

<p>The fact was that Florence had hurried
her a good deal, because Mr. Wingfield
was to show them the rosettes the horses
were to wear on the wedding-day.</p>

<p>After all, Amy had to go up to her
room only half believed and unforgiven.
Her father had a great mind to have gone
to have had it out with Florence Cray
that night, but as some holiday people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
were there, he doubted whether he could
see her alone, and waited till the morning.
Then he called her into the parlour
and said:</p>

<p>"Florence Cray, what have you been
doing with my girl?"</p>

<p>"No harm, Mr. Lee," said Florence,
frightened, but therefore pert, and resolved
to stand up for her friend. "You
may trust me for that! I know what is
proper."</p>

<p>Mr. Lee made an odd sort of noise,
and said: "You do, eh! Proper to
deceive her friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! now, Mr. Lee," said Florence,
looking up in the droll, saucy way that
served her instead of beauty, "it was
only two old aunts. One always reckons
it fair play by an old aunt."</p>

<p>"Have done with nonsense like that,"
said Mr. Lee. "Now, Florence Cray,
mine is a girl with no mother. My
sisters, and I have done our best to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
her a good, innocent girl, and we can't
but feel it a hard thing that you should
come leading her to keep company, without
our knowledge, with a fellow that
you must know is not such as we would
approve."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I meant no harm," said
Florence, beginning to cry; "I only
thought it was dull for her, and took her
for a walk. And you needn't be afraid,
Mr. Lee, I never left them alone not one
minute, nor he never said one word; nor
did more than just shake hands. You
may trust me, Mr. Lee."</p>

<p>On the whole the Lees were satisfied
that the mischief had not gone as far as
such imprudence might have led. Mr.
Wingfield would be gone in a few days,
for the wedding was coming on, and
Amy was certainly not in love with him.
When she compared him with Ambrose
Cuthbert, she felt sick of having been
flattered for a moment by his attentions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and looked on the whole with the bitterest
shame, as having led her away from all
her good resolutions, and made her thus
deceive and disobey her father and aunts.
And when the knell rang for poor little
Edwin Smithers she cried more than ever,
feeling almost guilty of his death.</p>

<p>She never wished for a moment to
accept the invitation for which she had
once been so eager, to see Miss Robson's
wedding clothes and wedding presents.
Grace Hollis went and took Jessie, and
Florence Cray went too.</p>

<p>These were a sight! Such gilt clocks!
Such extraordinary contrivances for ink-stands,
toilette apparatus, dinner services,
and every service that could be thought
of! Such girdles, chatelaines, rings and
bracelets! Such silks and satins! such
garments for morning, noon, and night,
and even afternoon tea! And oh! such
dressing-gowns!</p>

<p>They sent Florence Cray home thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
over all the novels she had ever seen,
where a girl at an inn married a rich
man, and also thinking how to alter her
best hat.</p>

<p>They sent Grace Hollis home deep
in plans how to get another order for
plain work.</p>

<p>And they sent home, Jessie very happy
indeed, for a lady's-maid had asked
whether a dozen more handkerchiefs could
be marked with "Maude" in the same
style as the Nina.</p>

<p>Miss Needwood was really getting
quite prosperous.</p>

<p>The next day, almost every one, who
could, went to see as much as possible
of the wedding; so Aunt Rose had not
yet to endure the presence of Florence,
and to keep watch that she did not
chatter to Amy, who was drooping and
shame-stricken enough.</p>

<p>That morning came a letter from
Mrs. Cuthbert. She said she should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
lonesome without Ambrose; and would
her brother lend her his Amy for a few
weeks, when she would do her best for
the child, and not let her forget her
needlework? This made things much
easier to all; but Amy knew it was
a very different going from home from
what it might have been.</p>

<p>Before she came back, Florence Cray
had found what she called "working at
Old Lee's" so dull, that she had teased
her parents into requesting the return
of part of her premium, and binding her
to the chief milliner in Ellerby.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>WHICH SHALL PROSPER?</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Somers</span> had come home from his
six weeks' holiday, and was talking over
the village news with Miss Manners.</p>

<p>She told him of little Edwin Smithers's
death, of the summons to Jessie Hollis,
and of the visit of Mrs. Cuthbert.</p>

<p>"Of course it is wrong to judge," she
said, "but do you remember that Lenten
sermon, and the impression I told you
it made?"</p>

<p>"I remember well. It was on the
seed, and on bringing forth fruit."</p>

<p>"Well, when we had the Parable of
the Sower the other day, I could not
help thinking how it had worked out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
There were some, like that Cray girl,
who never seemed to take it in at all,
but left it as something outside of them.
Then three distinctly were moved to
undertake something, the two Hollises
and Amy Lee. Well, Grace dropped her
missionary needlework as soon as that
wedding order come in her way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be hard on her, Dora."</p>

<p>"No; but I'm afraid I can't help
seeing that she does not seem to keep
up her Sunday ways as she used. Then
there's a sharp, worn, fretted way. I
am very much afraid she is getting
choked with the thorns."</p>

<p>"I don't know Miss Hollis well," he
said, thoughtfully, "but I am afraid she
does not look much beyond her shop."</p>

<p>"And my poor little Amy Lee responding
so readily&mdash;seeming all that
could be wished, and then showing herself
so little able to stand temptation
from that silly girl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope there was no more than
silliness."</p>

<p>"I don't think there was; but still,
after all the care Rose and Charlotte
have taken to bring up that girl really
refined, it was very disappointing to find
her ready to be led away in an instant
by foolish, vulgar admiration; above all,
when it led her to neglect the good work
she was supposed to be doing, it showed
such shallowness."</p>

<p>"It is a comfort that often trials, and
even falls, do deepen the soil, so that
the roots may have a better hold another
time," said Mr. Somers. "I think there
is good hope that so it will be with poor
little Amy. And I think you have some
good soil to tell me of."</p>

<p>"Indeed I have. I am sure Jessie
Hollis has shown herself good soil, and
her work upon that very unpromising
Mary Smithers showed itself remarkably.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
But that was not all I was thinking of.
It seems to me that we have had a
glimpse of what the hundredfold produce
may be. Think of my dear sister Edith,
working away at her class when there
was much less help than now, and see
what some of them have grown up,
especially Amy Cuthbert. I know she
had a good home, and other helps; but
still I heard what she said of Edith's
teaching and training. It has helped
her to make that young Ambrose Cuthbert
what he is,&mdash;and what may not be
his harvest!"</p>

<p>"As though a man should cast seed
into the field," said Mr. Somers, thoughtfully.
"First the blade, then the ear,
after that the full corn in the ear."</p>

<p>"Ah! I am leaping on too fast. We
only see a little of the first-fruits," said
Miss Manners, "and take it for an
earnest of the rest." And then she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
repeated Bishop Heber's hymn, which
she had often taught the children:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"O God, by Whom the seed is given,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">By Whom the harvest blest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whose Word, like manna showers from heaven,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Is planted in our breast.</span><br />
<br />
"Preserve it from the passing feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From plunderers of the air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The sultry sun's intenser heat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And weeds of worldly care.</span><br />
<br />
"Though buried deep or thinly strewn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Do Thou Thy grace supply:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The hope in earthly furrows strewn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Shall ripen in the sky."</span><br />
